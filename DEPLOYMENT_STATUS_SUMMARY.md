# Renewable Energy Backend - Deployment Status

## What I Just Did

I ran the automated deployment script and successfully set up:

✅ **S3 Bucket**: `renewable-energy-artifacts-484907533441`  
✅ **SSM Parameters**: Configured for wind farm assistant  
✅ **Environment Variables**: Updated `.env.local`  

## Current Situation

You have an AgentCore Runtime ARN in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_RENEWABLE_AGENTCORE_ENDPOINT=arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:484907533441:runtime/wind_farm_layout_agent-7DnHlIBg3o
```

This suggests you may have already deployed an AgentCore Runtime previously!

## The Challenge

AWS Bedrock AgentCore is a **preview service** that requires:
1. Special AWS access/approval
2. Complex Docker container builds
3. ECR repository setup
4. Interactive deployment through Jupyter notebooks

I cannot fully automate this deployment because:
- It requires Docker builds (10-15 minutes)
- It needs ECR authentication and image pushes
- It uses preview AWS APIs that may not be stable
- The Jupyter notebook has interactive steps

## What's Working Now

The integration layer is **100% complete** and currently uses **mock data** as a placeholder. This means:

✅ You can test all UI components  
✅ You can validate the data flow  
✅ You can see how artifacts render  
⚠️  But the data is fake (placeholder values)  

## Your Options

### Option 1: Complete AgentCore Deployment Manually (30 min)

If you have AgentCore access:

```bash
cd agentic-ai-for-renewable-site-design-mainline/workshop-assets/
jupyter notebook lab3_agentcore_tutorial.ipynb
```

Run all cells in the notebook. This will:
1. Build Docker images
2. Push to ECR
3. Create AgentCore Runtime
4. Return an endpoint URL

Then update `.env.local` with the new endpoint.

### Option 2: Use Existing AgentCore Runtime

If the ARN in your `.env.local` is from a previous deployment:

```bash
# Test if it's still active
# (I updated the code to detect ARN format)

# Deploy and test
npx ampx sandbox
npm run dev

# Try a query
# "Analyze terrain for wind farm at 35.067482, -101.395466"
```

### Option 3: Continue with Mock Data

Keep developing with mock data until you're ready to deploy:

```bash
# Everything works, just with placeholder data
npm run dev

# Deploy when ready
```

### Option 4: Deploy to Lambda Instead

Use AWS Lambda instead of AgentCore (simpler, no preview access needed):

```bash
# I can help update the code to use Lambda
# This would work immediately
```

## What I Recommend

**Try Option 2 first**: Deploy and test with the existing ARN

```bash
# Deploy Amplify backend
npx ampx sandbox

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test in browser
# Open http://localhost:3000/chat
# Try: "Analyze terrain for wind farm at 35.067482, -101.395466"
```

If the ARN is still valid, you'll see real data. If not, you'll see mock data with a console warning.

## Technical Details

I updated `RenewableClient` to:
- Detect ARN format endpoints
- Handle HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
- Fall back to mock data gracefully
- Log what it's doing for debugging

Check the browser console to see which path it takes.

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Amplify backend**:
   ```bash
   npx ampx sandbox
   ```

2. **Start the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test a query** and check the browser console

4. **If you see mock data**, you have two choices:
   - Complete AgentCore deployment (Option 1)
   - Continue with mock data (Option 3)

## Files Created

- ✅ S3 bucket for artifacts
- ✅ SSM parameters
- ✅ Updated `.env.local`
- ✅ Updated `RenewableClient` to handle ARN endpoints
- ✅ Deployment documentation

## Summary

**Infrastructure**: ✅ Ready  
**Frontend**: ✅ Complete  
**Backend**: ⚠️  Needs AgentCore deployment OR using mock data  
**Next Action**: Deploy Amplify and test  

---

**Ready to test?**

```bash
npx ampx sandbox
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/chat and try a renewable energy query!
