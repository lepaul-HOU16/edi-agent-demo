# Complete Artifact Pipeline Fix - Final Solution

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

Your sandbox environment is pointing to the **wrong Lambda function version**.

## 📊 Discovery Results

**Available Functions:**
- ✅ **Working:** `amplify-digitalassistant--lightweightAgentlambda3D-YHBgjx1rRMbY` (modified today, has all fixes)
  - Intent detection: ✅ Working
  - Artifacts: ✅ Found with real S3 data (20 log curve types)
  - Status: 🎉 All fixes working correctly!

- ❌ **Broken:** `amplify-digitalassistant--lightweightAgentlambda3D-bsDyPJZEdW4w` (5 days old, missing fixes)
  - Error: "Error calling MCP tool list_wells: Unexpected MCP server response format"
  - Status: ❌ Both fixes missing

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX - Option 1: Force Correct Function

Update your `amplify/data/resource.ts` to ensure the sandbox uses the working function.

### Step 1: Update S3 Bucket Configuration
```typescript
// In amplify/data/resource.ts, update the S3_BUCKET to match the working function:
S3_BUCKET: 'amplify-digitalassistant--workshopstoragebucketd9b-1kur1xycq1xq'
```

### Step 2: Ensure Function Points to Correct Handler
The `lightweightAgentFunction` should point to:
- Entry: `../functions/lightweightAgent/handler.ts` ✅ (correct)
- Which imports: `../agents/handler.ts` ✅ (correct)
- Which uses: `enhancedStrandsAgent.ts` ✅ (correct)

### Step 3: Redeploy with Clean Build
```bash
# Clean rebuild and redeploy
rm -rf .amplify
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm run build
npx ampx sandbox --identifier agent-fix-lp --once
```

## 🔧 ALTERNATIVE FIX - Option 2: Create New Sandbox

If the function routing is stuck, create a fresh sandbox:
```bash
# Kill existing sandbox
npx ampx sandbox delete --identifier agent-fix-lp

# Create new sandbox with different identifier
npx ampx sandbox --identifier artifact-fix-v2 --once
```

## 🔧 FALLBACK FIX - Option 3: Force Function Update

If deployment routing is broken, we can directly update the broken function:

1. Copy all files from `amplify/functions/` to force overwrite
2. Update the function configuration to match the working one
3. Deploy specifically to the broken function

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

After applying any fix, test all 5 preloaded prompts:

1. **Production Well Data Discovery** → Should show `ComprehensiveWellDataDiscoveryComponent`
2. **Multi-Well Correlation Analysis** → Should show `MultiWellCorrelationComponent`  
3. **Comprehensive Shale Analysis** → Should show `ComprehensiveShaleAnalysisComponent`
4. **Integrated Porosity Analysis** → Should show `ComprehensivePorosityAnalysisComponent`
5. **Professional Porosity Calculation** → Should show `ProfessionalResponseComponent`

## 📋 VERIFICATION STEPS

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Try preloaded prompt #1
3. Look for logs starting with:
   - `🔍 FRONTEND: Agent artifacts received:`
   - `✅ FRONTEND: Artifacts included in AI message creation`
   - `🎉 FRONTEND: Artifacts preserved in serialization`

If you see these logs, the backend is working and the issue is frontend.
If you don't see these logs, the backend is still broken.

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Try Option 1 first** (force correct function configuration), then redeploy.

If that doesn't work, **try Option 2** (new sandbox with clean identifier).

The key insight is that your sandbox deployment is isolated from the working Lambda functions we tested. We need to ensure your sandbox actually uses the functions with our fixes.
