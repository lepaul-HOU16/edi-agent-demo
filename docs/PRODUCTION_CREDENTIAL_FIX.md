# Production AWS Credentials Configuration Fix

## Problem Summary
Your Amplify deployment is failing because AWS credentials are not properly configured for production. Amplify hosting requires custom AWS credentials with the `AMPLIFY_` prefix instead of standard `AWS_` prefixed environment variables.

**Error Details:**
- Status: `configuration_error`
- Error: "AWS credentials not configured for production deployment"
- Details: "Amplify hosting requires custom AWS credentials (AWS_ prefix not allowed)"
- Bucket: `amplify-d1eeg2gu6ddc3z-ma-workshopstoragebucketd9b-lzf4vwokty7m`
- Region: `us-east-1`

## Root Cause
The application code expects AWS credentials to be available, but Amplify's production environment requires these to be set with custom names using the `AMPLIFY_` prefix. Standard `AWS_` prefixed environment variables are not allowed in Amplify hosting.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Access Amplify Console
1. Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home)
2. Find your application: `d1eeg2gu6ddc3z`
3. Click on the application name

### Step 2: Navigate to Environment Variables
1. In the left sidebar, click **"App settings"**
2. Click **"Environment variables"**
   - Alternative: Look for "Hosting" ‚Üí "Environment variables"

### Step 3: Add Required Environment Variables
Click **"Manage variables"** and add these 4 variables:

#### Required Variables:
```
AMPLIFY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = [YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID]
AMPLIFY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = [YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]  
AMPLIFY_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN = [YOUR_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN]
AMPLIFY_AWS_REGION = us-east-1
```

**Where to get the values:**
- Copy the exact values from your local `.env.local` file
- These are the same credentials that work in your local development environment

### Step 4: Application Code Updated ‚úÖ
The application code has been updated in `utils/amplifyUtils.ts` to handle both production (`AMPLIFY_` prefix) and development (`AWS_` prefix) credentials automatically.

**Key Changes Made:**
- Added `getAWSCredentials()` helper function that prioritizes `AMPLIFY_` prefixed variables
- Falls back to standard `AWS_` variables for local development
- Updated `getConfiguredAmplifyClient()` to use the new credential system
- Updated `setAmplifyEnvVars()` to work with both credential systems

### Step 5: Redeploy Application
After adding the environment variables in Amplify Console:

1. **Go to the main branch**
   - In left sidebar, click "App settings" ‚Üí "Branches" 
   - Or look for "Hosting" section and find your branch (usually "main")

2. **Redeploy the application**
   - Find the "main" branch in the list
   - Click the "..." menu (three dots) next to the branch
   - Select "Redeploy this version"
   - **OR** click the branch name, then click "Redeploy this version" button

3. **Wait for deployment**
   - Watch the deployment progress
   - Should take 2-5 minutes to complete
   - Look for "Deployed" status

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Test the S3 Health Endpoint
After deployment completes, test the endpoint:

```bash
curl https://main.d1eeg2gu6ddc3z.amplifyapp.com/api/health/s3
```

**Expected Success Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "message": "S3 connectivity verified",
  "details": {
    "bucketName": "amplify-d1eeg2gu6ddc3z-ma-workshopstoragebucketd9b-lzf4vwokty7m",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "objectCount": 1,
    "responseTime": "200ms"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Check Application Logs (if needed)
If it still doesn't work:
1. Go to your Amplify app in the console
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click "View build logs" to see any errors
4. Look for credential-related error messages

## Environment Variables Summary

**IMPORTANT**: Amplify doesn't allow variables starting with "AWS_", so we use custom names:

```
AMPLIFY_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = [YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_ENV_LOCAL]
AMPLIFY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = [YOUR_SECRET_KEY_FROM_ENV_LOCAL]
AMPLIFY_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN = [YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN_FROM_ENV_LOCAL]
AMPLIFY_AWS_REGION = us-east-1
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Variables Not Showing Up
- **Solution**: Make sure you clicked "Save" after adding variables
- Check that you're in the right app (d1eeg2gu6ddc3z)

### Issue 2: Still Getting Credential Errors
- **Solution**: Verify you copied the credentials exactly from .env.local
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or line breaks
- Check that AMPLIFY_AWS_REGION is set to "us-east-1"

### Issue 3: Temporary Credentials Expired
If using temporary credentials that expire:
- **Solution**: Refresh your AWS credentials using:
  ```bash
  aws sso login  # if using SSO
  # or
  aws configure  # if using long-term credentials
  ```
- Update the Amplify environment variables with new credentials

### Issue 4: Can't Find Environment Variables Section
- Try refreshing the Amplify console page
- Look under "App settings" ‚Üí "Environment variables"
- Or try "Hosting" ‚Üí "Environment variables"

## Security Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è These credentials will be visible to anyone with Amplify console access
- üîí Consider using IAM roles instead of access keys for production
- üîÑ Rotate credentials regularly
- üìä Monitor usage in CloudTrail

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Add environment variables in Amplify Console
2. ‚úÖ Redeploy the application
3. ‚úÖ Test the S3 health endpoint
4. ‚úÖ Monitor application logs for any remaining issues

After completing these steps and redeploying, your production deployment should have proper AWS credentials configured and the S3 connectivity issues should be resolved.
