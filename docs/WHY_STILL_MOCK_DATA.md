# 🔍 Why You're Still Seeing Mock Data

**Root Cause**: Code changes are local only - Lambda hasn't been deployed yet!

---

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ What's Done
- Code changes made to `renewableClient.ts`
- AWS SDK package installed locally
- Environment variables configured in `.env.local`

### ❌ What's Missing
- **Backend deployment** - Lambda still has old code from September 29th!

## 🎯 The Issue

```
Your Local Files (Updated Today)
    ↓
    ❌ NOT DEPLOYED YET
    ↓
AWS Lambda (Last updated: Sept 29, 2025)
    ↓
Still running OLD code with mock data
```

---

## ✅ Solution: Deploy the Backend

### Quick Deploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy-with-renewable-enabled.sh
```

This will:
1. Export environment variables
2. Build and deploy Lambda with new code
3. Update Lambda with AWS SDK package
4. Takes 2-3 minutes

### Manual Deploy

```bash
# Export environment variables
export NEXT_PUBLIC_RENEWABLE_ENABLED=true
export NEXT_PUBLIC_RENEWABLE_AGENTCORE_ENDPOINT="arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:484907533441:agent-runtime/wind_farm_layout_agent-7DnHlIBg3o"
export NEXT_PUBLIC_RENEWABLE_S3_BUCKET="renewable-energy-artifacts-484907533441"
export NEXT_PUBLIC_RENEWABLE_REGION="us-east-1"

# Deploy
npx ampx sandbox --once
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After deployment, check Lambda was updated:

```bash
aws lambda get-function-configuration \
  --function-name amplify-digitalassistant--lightweightAgentlambda3D-YHBgjx1rRMbY \
  --query 'LastModified' \
  --output text
```

Should show today's date!

---

## 🧪 After Deployment

### 1. Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Again

```
Analyze wind farm potential at coordinates 35.067482, -101.395466
```

### 3. Check Lambda Logs

```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/amplify-digitalassistant--lightweightAgentlambda3D-YHBgjx1rRMbY --follow
```

Look for:
```
RenewableClient: Detected AgentCore Runtime ARN
RenewableClient: Calling AgentCore Runtime
RenewableClient: Sending command to AgentCore
```

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run deployment script or `npx ampx sandbox --once`
- [ ] Wait for "Deployment complete" message (2-3 min)
- [ ] Verify Lambda LastModified is today
- [ ] Restart dev server
- [ ] Test renewable query
- [ ] Check Lambda logs for real API calls

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Only restarting dev server
- ❌ Dev server restart only affects frontend
- ✅ Must deploy backend to update Lambda

### Mistake 2: Assuming code changes auto-deploy
- ❌ Local code changes don't automatically deploy
- ✅ Must run `npx ampx sandbox` to deploy

### Mistake 3: Not exporting environment variables
- ❌ Lambda won't have config without env vars
- ✅ Export vars before deploying

## 🎯 Quick Fix Right Now

Run this single command:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-with-renewable-enabled.sh
```

Wait 2-3 minutes, then test again. You'll get real data!

## 📊 What Happens During Deployment

```
1. Amplify builds Lambda package
   ├── Includes your updated renewableClient.ts
   ├── Includes @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-agent-runtime
   └── Bundles all dependencies

2. Amplify uploads to AWS
   ├── Creates new Lambda version
   ├── Sets environment variables
   └── Updates function configuration

3. Lambda is ready
   ├── New code is live
   ├── AWS SDK is available
   └── Real API calls will work
```

---

## ✨ Expected Timeline

- **Start deployment**: `./scripts/deploy-with-renewable-enabled.sh`
- **Wait**: 2-3 minutes
- **Restart dev**: `npm run dev`
- **Test**: Try renewable query
- **Result**: Real data! 🎉

---

**🚀 Deploy now!**

```bash
./scripts/deploy-with-renewable-enabled.sh
```

This is the final step to get real data working!
