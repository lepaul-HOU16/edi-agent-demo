# Task 2 Complete: Removed Incorrectly Converted TypeScript Files

## ✅ What Was Done

### Files Moved to Deprecated Directory

All incorrectly converted TypeScript files have been moved to `docs/deprecated/renewable-typescript-attempt/`:

1. ✅ `renewableEnergyAgent.ts` - Multi-agent system (37KB)
2. ✅ `renewableTerrainAnalysisTool.ts` - Terrain analysis tool (11KB)
3. ✅ `renewableLayoutOptimizationTool.ts` - Layout optimization tool (13KB)
4. ✅ `renewableSimulationTool.ts` - Wake simulation tool (24KB)

**Total**: ~86KB of incorrect code removed from active codebase

### Code References Updated

Updated `amplify/functions/agents/agentRouter.ts`:
- ✅ Commented out import of `RenewableEnergyAgent`
- ✅ Commented out renewable agent initialization
- ✅ Added placeholder response for renewable queries
- ✅ Added TODO comments for future integration
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

### Documentation Created

Created `docs/deprecated/renewable-typescript-attempt/README.md` documenting:
- Why these files were incorrect
- What was lost in the conversion
- The correct approach for integration
- Date deprecated and reason for preservation

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Task 2:
- ❌ Incorrect TypeScript implementations in active codebase
- ❌ Mock data instead of real Python agents
- ❌ Lost PyWake simulation engine
- ❌ Lost GIS processing with geopandas
- ❌ Lost Folium/matplotlib visualizations

### After Task 2:
- ✅ Incorrect code moved to deprecated directory
- ✅ Clean slate for proper integration
- ✅ Agent router updated with placeholders
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Clear documentation of what was wrong

## 📊 Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `amplify/functions/agents/agentRouter.ts`
   - Commented out renewable agent import
   - Commented out renewable agent initialization
   - Added placeholder response for renewable queries

### Files Moved:
1. `amplify/functions/agents/renewableEnergyAgent.ts` → `docs/deprecated/`
2. `amplify/functions/tools/renewableTerrainAnalysisTool.ts` → `docs/deprecated/`
3. `amplify/functions/tools/renewableLayoutOptimizationTool.ts` → `docs/deprecated/`
4. `amplify/functions/tools/renewableSimulationTool.ts` → `docs/deprecated/`

### Files Created:
1. `docs/deprecated/renewable-typescript-attempt/README.md`

## ✅ Verification

- [x] All renewable TypeScript files moved to deprecated directory
- [x] Agent router imports updated
- [x] Agent router initialization updated
- [x] Placeholder response added for renewable queries
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] No diagnostics errors
- [x] Documentation created

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Task 3**: Create Integration Layer Foundation
- Create `src/services/renewable-integration/` directory
- Define TypeScript types
- Implement configuration management

## 📝 Notes

The renewable agent routing logic is still present in the router but returns a placeholder message. This allows:
1. Renewable queries to be detected correctly
2. Users to receive a friendly message
3. Easy re-enabling once proper integration is complete

The pattern detection logic remains intact so we can test routing without the actual agent implementation.
