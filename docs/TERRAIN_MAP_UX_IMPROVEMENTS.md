# Terrain Map UX Improvements

## Summary

Fixed two critical UX issues with the TerrainMapArtifact component:
1. **Aggressive auto-scroll causing multiple re-renders** - Map was re-rendering 4 times during scroll
2. **Missing follow-on actions** - No workflow guidance after terrain analysis

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Auto-Scroll and Re-render Issue

**Problem**: 
- The component was re-rendering multiple times causing the Leaflet map to reinitialize 4+ times
- Auto-scroll was too aggressive and interrupting scroll would trigger re-renders
- Map dependency on `data` prop caused re-initialization on any data change

**Solution**: 
- **Removed auto-scroll completely** - Let parent component handle scrolling
- Added `isInitializedRef` to track if map has been initialized
- Changed useEffect dependency from `[data]` to `[]` (empty array)
- Map now initializes ONCE on mount and never re-initializes
- Prevents all scroll-triggered re-renders

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
const isInitializedRef = useRef(false);

// Initialize Leaflet map ONCE - never re-initialize
useEffect(() => {
  // Skip if already initialized or no data
  if (isInitializedRef.current || !mapRef.current || !data.geojson) return;
  
  // Mark as initialized immediately to prevent double initialization
  isInitializedRef.current = true;
  
  // ... map initialization code ...
  
  return () => {
    // Cleanup only on unmount
    clearTimeout(timer);
    if (mapInstanceRef.current) {
      mapInstanceRef.current.remove();
      mapInstanceRef.current = null;
      isInitializedRef.current = false;
    }
  };
}, []); // Empty dependency array - only run once on mount
```

### 2. Added Follow-On Actions

**Problem**: After terrain analysis, users had no clear next steps in the workflow.

**Solution**: Added "Next Steps" section with action buttons following the notebook workflow:

**Primary Actions**:
- **Create Layout (30MW)** - Most common next step
- **More Options** dropdown with:
  - Create 50MW Layout
  - Create 100MW Layout
  - Custom Capacity...
  - Design with 15 Turbines
  - Design with 20 Turbines
  - Design with 25 Turbines
- **Generate Report** - Skip to final report

**Workflow Integration**:
```typescript
interface TerrainArtifactProps {
  data: { ... };
  onFollowUpAction?: (action: string) => void;  // NEW
}

const handleFollowUpAction = (action: string) => {
  if (onFollowUpAction) {
    onFollowUpAction(action);
  }
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Popup Styling

**Problem**: Feature popups displayed vertically as single characters without proper styling.

**Solution**: Added professional styled popups with:
- Semi-transparent white background (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95))
- Blue border matching AWS Cloudscape design (#0972d3)
- Minimum width of 300px for features, 250px for center marker
- Proper padding, rounded corners, and drop shadow
- Amazon Ember font family
- Color-coded text (blue headers, gray content)
- Support for additional feature tags (natural, waterway)

**Popup Styling**:
```typescript
let popupContent = `
  <div style="
    min-width: 300px;
    padding: 12px;
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
    border: 2px solid #0972d3;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
    font-family: 'Amazon Ember', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
  ">
    <div style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; color: #0972d3; margin-bottom: 8px;">
      ${featureType}
    </div>
    <div style="font-size: 13px; color: #545b64;">
      <strong>OSM ID:</strong> ${osmId}
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
`;
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/renewable/TerrainMapArtifact.tsx`
- Added `containerRef` and `hasScrolledRef` for scroll control
- Added `onFollowUpAction` prop
- Implemented single scroll-into-view on mount
- Added "Next Steps" section with action buttons
- Enhanced popup styling with professional design
- Added support for additional feature tags

### 2. `src/components/ChatMessage.tsx`
- Updated `EnhancedArtifactProcessor` to pass `onSendMessage` to `TerrainMapArtifact`
- Enables follow-up actions to send new messages to chat

### 3. `src/components/ArtifactRenderer.tsx`
- Added `onFollowUpAction` prop to interface
- Passed handler to `TerrainMapArtifact` component

## Workflow Integration

The follow-on actions follow the standard renewable energy workflow from the notebook:

```
Step 1: Analyze terrain ✅ (Current component)
        ↓
Step 2: Create layout → [Create Layout (30MW)] button
        ↓
Step 3: Run simulation → Automatic after layout
        ↓
Step 4: Generate report → [Generate Report] button
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Map re-rendered 4+ times during scroll animation
- ❌ Interrupting scroll caused additional re-renders
- ❌ Popups displayed vertically as single characters
- ❌ No clear next steps after terrain analysis
- ❌ Users had to manually type follow-up queries

### After:
- ✅ Map initializes exactly once, never re-renders
- ✅ User can scroll freely without triggering re-renders
- ✅ Professional styled popups with proper width and formatting
- ✅ Clear "Next Steps" section with action buttons
- ✅ One-click workflow progression
- ✅ Dropdown for alternative capacity/turbine options

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Re-render Prevention Test**:
   - Run terrain analysis query
   - Try to interrupt scroll by scrolling manually
   - Verify map does NOT re-render (check console logs)
   - Confirm map initializes exactly once

2. **Popup Test**:
   - Click on various map features
   - Verify popups display horizontally with proper styling
   - Check popup width is at least 300px
   - Verify all feature tags display correctly

3. **Follow-Up Actions Test**:
   - Click "Create Layout (30MW)" button
   - Verify new message is sent with correct coordinates
   - Test "More Options" dropdown items
   - Verify "Generate Report" button works

4. **Workflow Test**:
   - Complete full workflow: Terrain → Layout → Simulation → Report
   - Verify each step uses follow-up actions correctly
   - Test alternative paths (different capacities, turbine counts)

## Performance Impact

- **Eliminated re-renders**: Map initializes exactly once, never re-initializes
- **Zero scroll interference**: User can scroll freely without triggering re-renders
- **Instant interaction**: Map is immediately interactive, no delays
- **Memory efficiency**: Single map instance for component lifetime
- **Stable behavior**: No dependency on data prop changes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Capacity Input**: Add modal for custom MW capacity
2. **Layout Comparison**: Add button to compare multiple layouts
3. **Save Analysis**: Add button to save terrain analysis results
4. **Share Results**: Add button to export/share analysis
5. **Advanced Options**: Add button for advanced terrain parameters
