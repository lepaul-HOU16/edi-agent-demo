# üéØ ROOT CAUSE FOUND!

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Issue**: Mock data persists despite deployment  
**Root Cause**: Wrong AWS SDK - using Bedrock Agent Runtime instead of AgentCore

---

## üîç The Problem

The code is calling the **wrong AWS service**!

### Current Code (WRONG):
```typescript
const client = new BedrockAgentRuntimeClient({ region });
const command = new InvokeAgentCommand({
  agentId: runtimeId,
  agentAliasId: 'TSTALIASID',
  ...
});
```

### Why It Fails:
- **BedrockAgentRuntimeClient** is for AWS Bedrock Agents (different service)
- **AgentCore** is a separate service with its own API
- The SDK call fails, catches the error, and falls back to mock data
- You never see the error because it's caught and logged

---

## üéØ The Real Solution

AgentCore runtimes are **HTTP endpoints**, not AWS SDK services. We need to:

1. Get the HTTP endpoint URL for the runtime
2. Make a direct HTTP POST request
3. NOT use the Bedrock Agent Runtime SDK

### Correct Approach:

AgentCore runtimes expose HTTP endpoints. We need to:
1. Get the runtime endpoint URL from AgentCore Control API
2. Call that HTTP endpoint directly
3. Pass authentication via Cognito tokens

---

## üîß Why Mock Data Keeps Appearing

```
1. Code detects ARN format ‚úÖ
2. Tries to call BedrockAgentRuntimeClient ‚ùå (wrong service!)
3. SDK call fails (AgentCore != Bedrock Agent Runtime)
4. Catches error silently
5. Falls back to getMockResponse() ‚ùå
6. Returns mock data
```

---

## ‚úÖ Actual Fix Needed

### Option 1: Use AgentCore Control API (Recommended)

```typescript
// Get runtime endpoint from AgentCore Control API
const controlClient = new BedrockAgentCoreControlClient({ region });
const getRuntimeCommand = new GetAgentRuntimeCommand({
  agentRuntimeId: runtimeId
});
const runtimeInfo = await controlClient.send(getRuntimeCommand);
const endpointUrl = runtimeInfo.endpoint; // HTTP URL

// Call the HTTP endpoint
const response = await fetch(endpointUrl, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${cognitoToken}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: request.prompt,
    sessionId: request.sessionId
  })
});
```

### Option 2: Direct HTTP Call (Simpler)

Since you already have the runtime deployed and know it's accessible, we can:
1. Get the HTTP endpoint URL from the AgentCore console
2. Store it in environment variables
3. Make direct HTTP calls

---

## üöÄ Immediate Action

The renewable energy backend is **already deployed and working** via the Jupyter notebook. The issue is just connecting to it correctly.

### Quick Fix:

1. Get the actual HTTP endpoint URL for your runtime
2. Update the code to use HTTP instead of AWS SDK
3. Test with direct HTTP call

---

## üìä Evidence

From your logs, the code path is:
```
RenewableClient: Detected AgentCore Runtime ARN ‚úÖ
RenewableClient: Calling AgentCore Runtime ‚úÖ
RenewableClient: Sending command to AgentCore ‚úÖ
RenewableClient: AWS SDK error: [hidden] ‚ùå
RenewableClient: Falling back to mock response ‚ùå
RenewableClient: Generating mock response ‚ùå
```

The SDK error is being caught and you're seeing mock data as the fallback.

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Check if there's an AgentCore Control SDK available
2. If not, use direct HTTP calls to the runtime endpoint
3. Get the actual endpoint URL from AWS console or CLI
4. Update the code to use the correct API

---

**The good news**: Your AgentCore runtime IS deployed and working. We just need to call it correctly!
