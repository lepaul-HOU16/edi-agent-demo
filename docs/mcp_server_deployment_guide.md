# MCP Server Deployment Options

## 🎯 **Deployment Decision Tree**

### **Current Setup Assessment**
- ✅ **MCP Server Code**: `mcp-well-data-server.py` (ready)
- ✅ **Quality System**: Response validation and templates (ready)
- ❓ **Deployment Target**: Where does your enhanced agent run?

## 🚀 **Deployment Options**

### **Option A: AWS Amplify Sandbox (if using Amplify)**
```bash
# Only if your enhanced agent is part of an Amplify project
npx ampx sandbox --once

# This would deploy your MCP server as part of the Amplify infrastructure
```

### **Option B: Standalone Cloud Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy MCP server independently (recommended for production)

# 1. Docker deployment
docker build -t petrophysical-mcp-server .
docker run -p 8000:8000 petrophysical-mcp-server

# 2. AWS Lambda deployment
# 3. Google Cloud Run deployment
# 4. Azure Container Instances deployment
```

### **Option C: Local Development with Remote Access**
```bash
# For development/testing
python mcp-well-data-server.py
# Then use ngrok or similar for remote access
```

## 📋 **What You Actually Need to Deploy**

### **If Enhanced Agent is Local/On-Premise**
- Deploy only the MCP server to cloud
- Quality system runs locally with your agent

### **If Enhanced Agent is Cloud-Based**
- Deploy MCP server to cloud
- Deploy enhanced agent with quality system to cloud
- Both can be in same or different cloud environments

### **If Using Amplify for Full Stack**
- Use `npx ampx sandbox --once` to deploy everything together
- Include MCP server in your Amplify project structure

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach**

### **For Production**
1. **Deploy MCP Server Independently**
   ```bash
   # Use Docker + cloud container service
   # Provides better scalability and isolation
   ```

2. **Integrate Quality System Locally**
   ```python
   # Quality system runs within your enhanced agent
   # No separate deployment needed
   ```

### **For Development/Testing**
1. **Local MCP Server**
   ```bash
   python mcp-well-data-server.py
   ```

2. **Local Quality System**
   ```python
   # Run enhanced agent with quality validation locally
   ```

## 🔍 **Deployment Decision Factors**

### **Use Amplify Deployment If:**
- Your enhanced agent is part of an Amplify project
- You want integrated deployment and management
- You're using other Amplify services

### **Use Standalone Deployment If:**
- MCP server needs independent scaling
- Enhanced agent runs in different environment
- You want microservices architecture
- Better production control and monitoring needed

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Determine Your Architecture**
   - Where does your enhanced agent currently run?
   - Do you need the MCP server in the cloud?
   - Are you using Amplify for other components?

2. **Choose Deployment Method**
   - Amplify: `npx ampx sandbox --once`
   - Standalone: Docker + cloud service
   - Local: Direct Python execution

3. **Integrate Quality System**
   - Add quality validation to your enhanced agent
   - Configure professional response templates
   - Test end-to-end functionality
