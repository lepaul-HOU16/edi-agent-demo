# Console Errors and S3 Permissions Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Console Errors
- **Fixed incomplete SVG path** in the settings icon that was causing React warnings
- **Fixed typo** in chat session initialization ("initilize" â†’ "initialize")
- **Added proper error handling** for chat session creation
- **Added error boundary** to catch and handle React errors gracefully
- **Improved async/await usage** to prevent unhandled promise rejections

### 2. S3 Permissions Issues
- **Created centralized AWS configuration** (`src/utils/awsConfig.ts`) for consistent credential handling
- **Updated IAM policies** in `amplify/backend.ts` to include proper S3 permissions for production
- **Added Amplify app execution role** with S3 access permissions
- **Enhanced error handling** in S3 routes with environment-specific troubleshooting
- **Updated health check endpoint** to use new configuration system

### 3. Production Deployment
- **Created proper amplify.yml** with build optimizations and S3 connectivity testing
- **Added environment-specific credential handling** (development vs production)
- **Implemented proper CORS headers** for file serving
- **Added cache control headers** to prevent caching issues

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
- `src/app/chat/[chatSessionId]/page.tsx` - Fixed SVG path and error handling
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added error boundary and fixed initialization typo
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - New error boundary component
- `src/utils/awsConfig.ts` - New centralized AWS configuration

### S3 and Backend
- `amplify/backend.ts` - Enhanced IAM permissions for production
- `src/app/file/[...s3Key]/route.ts` - Updated to use new AWS config
- `src/app/api/health/s3/route.ts` - Enhanced health check with better error handling

### Deployment
- `amplify.yml` - New deployment configuration with proper headers and testing

## Deployment Steps

### For AWS Amplify Hosting

1. **Deploy the backend changes:**
   ```bash
   npx ampx sandbox
   ```
   
   Or for production deployment:
   ```bash
   npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch main
   ```

2. **Test S3 connectivity:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health/s3
   ```

3. **Verify the deployment:**
   - Check that the health endpoint returns "healthy" status
   - Test file access through the `/file/` route
   - Monitor browser console for any remaining errors

### For Local Development

1. **Ensure AWS credentials are configured:**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # OR set environment variables in .env.local:
   # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
   # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
   # AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health/s3
   ```

## Verification Checklist

### Console Errors
- [ ] No React warnings about incomplete SVG paths
- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections in chat creation
- [ ] Error boundary catches and displays errors gracefully
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in the build process

### S3 Permissions
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns "healthy" status
- [ ] Files can be accessed through `/file/` routes
- [ ] Proper error messages for missing files (404) vs permission issues (403)
- [ ] Production deployment can access S3 without hardcoded credentials

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Amplify build completes successfully
- [ ] S3 connectivity test passes during build
- [ ] CORS headers are properly set for file serving
- [ ] Cache control headers prevent stale file issues

## Troubleshooting

### If S3 Health Check Fails

1. **Check the health endpoint response:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/health/s3
   ```

2. **Common issues and solutions:**
   - **Credentials Error**: Ensure Amplify app has proper IAM role attached
   - **Access Denied**: Check S3 bucket policy and IAM permissions
   - **Bucket Not Found**: Verify bucket name in amplify_outputs.json

### If Console Errors Persist

1. **Check browser developer tools:**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - Check Network tab for failed requests
   - Monitor Console tab for JavaScript errors

2. **Common fixes:**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Check for any remaining hardcoded values
   - Verify all imports are correct

## Security Notes

- **Never commit AWS credentials** to the repository
- **Use IAM roles** in production instead of access keys
- **Rotate credentials regularly** and monitor CloudTrail for unusual activity
- **Apply least privilege principle** to all IAM policies

## Performance Optimizations

- **Implemented proper caching headers** to prevent unnecessary S3 requests
- **Added error boundaries** to prevent entire app crashes
- **Optimized build process** with proper dependency caching
- **Enhanced error handling** to provide better user experience

## Monitoring

The health check endpoint at `/api/health/s3` provides detailed information about:
- S3 connectivity status
- Environment configuration
- Credential availability
- Troubleshooting recommendations

Use this endpoint for automated monitoring and alerting in production.
