# üéØ FINAL SOLUTION - Real Root Cause

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Root cause identified, solution ready

---

## üîç The REAL Problem

The boto3 Python client uses:
```python
client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore')  # Special preview service
client.invoke_agent_runtime(agentRuntimeArn=arn, ...)
```

But there's **NO TypeScript/JavaScript SDK** for `bedrock-agentcore` yet! It's a preview service.

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

Since there's no official SDK, we have **two options**:

### Option 1: Use AWS SDK's Generic Client (Recommended)

Use the AWS SDK's low-level API client to call the service directly:

```typescript
import { ServiceClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-agent-runtime';

// This won't work because bedrock-agentcore isn't in the SDK yet
```

### Option 2: Direct HTTP with AWS Signature V4 (Complex)

Make signed HTTP requests to the AgentCore API endpoint.

### Option 3: Keep Mock Data (Pragmatic)

**The renewable energy backend IS working** - it's just not integrated with your main app yet. The mock data is actually fine for demonstration purposes.

---

## üéØ Recommended Path Forward

Given that:
1. AgentCore is a preview service without full SDK support
2. The integration requires complex AWS Signature V4 signing
3. Your main petrophysics features work perfectly
4. The renewable backend IS deployed and working (via Jupyter)

**Recommendation**: 

**Keep the mock data for now** and document that renewable energy integration requires:
- AgentCore SDK support (coming soon)
- Or custom HTTP client with AWS Signature V4
- Or Python backend proxy

---

## üîß If You Want Real Data Now

### Quick Win: Python Proxy

Create a simple Python Lambda that:
1. Receives requests from your TypeScript code
2. Uses boto3 to call AgentCore (which works!)
3. Returns results to TypeScript

This bypasses the SDK limitation.

---

## üìä What We Learned

1. ‚úÖ Your AgentCore runtime IS deployed and working
2. ‚úÖ The Jupyter notebook can call it successfully
3. ‚ùå There's no TypeScript SDK for `bedrock-agentcore` yet
4. ‚ùå We've been trying to use the wrong SDK (`bedrock-agent-runtime`)
5. ‚úÖ Mock data is a reasonable fallback until SDK support arrives

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Your Choice)

### Option A: Accept Mock Data (5 minutes)
- Document that renewable features use mock data
- Wait for AWS to release AgentCore SDK
- Everything else works perfectly

### Option B: Python Proxy (2 hours)
- Create Python Lambda function
- Use boto3 to call AgentCore
- Proxy requests from TypeScript
- Get real data working

### Option C: Custom HTTP Client (4+ hours)
- Implement AWS Signature V4 signing
- Make direct HTTP calls to AgentCore
- Complex but no additional Lambda needed

---

## üí° My Recommendation

**Go with Option A** (mock data) because:

1. Your core petrophysics features work great
2. AgentCore is preview/experimental
3. Mock data demonstrates the UI/UX perfectly
4. You can switch to real data when SDK is available
5. The renewable backend IS working - just not integrated yet

The integration isn't broken - it's just waiting for AWS to release the proper SDK support.

---

**Bottom line**: This isn't a bug in your code - it's a limitation of AWS's preview service not having full SDK support yet.
