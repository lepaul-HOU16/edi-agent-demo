# Renewable Energy Integration - Current Status

## Executive Summary

✅ **Integration Layer**: 100% Complete  
❌ **Backend Deployment**: Not Yet Deployed  
📊 **Current State**: Using mock data for development  
🎯 **Next Step**: Deploy AgentCore backend (~30 minutes)

## What's Missing

### Backend Deployment (0%)

The Python-based multi-agent system needs to be deployed to AWS Bedrock AgentCore:

❌ **AgentCore Runtime** - Not deployed  
❌ **MCP Server** - Not deployed  
❌ **Docker Images** - Not built  
❌ **Lambda Functions** - Not created  

**Why It's Missing**: AgentCore deployment requires:
1. AWS Bedrock AgentCore access (preview feature)
2. Docker build and ECR push (~10 minutes)
3. AgentCore Runtime creation (~10 minutes)
4. Testing and validation (~10 minutes)

**Total Time**: ~30 minutes

## Current Behavior

### What You See Now

When you query the system:

```
Query: "Analyze terrain for wind farm at 35.067482, -101.395466"
```

**Response**:
- ✅ Query is detected as renewable
- ✅ Routed to renewable proxy agent
- ⚠️  **Mock data is returned** (not real analysis)
- ✅ UI components render correctly
- ✅ Thought steps display
- ✅ Artifacts show (but with fake data)

**Browser Console**:
```
⚠️  RenewableClient: Using mock response (AWS SDK integration pending)
```

### Mock Data Example

```json
{
  "message": "Terrain analysis completed successfully...",
  "artifacts": [{
    "type": "terrain",
    "data": {
      "mapHtml": "<div>Mock Folium Map - Terrain Analysis</div>",
      "metrics": {
        "suitabilityScore": 85,
        "exclusionZones": 3
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

**This is intentional** - it allows frontend development without waiting for backend deployment.

## After Backend Deployment

### What You'll See

When you query the system after deployment:

```
Query: "Analyze terrain for wind farm at 35.067482, -101.395466"
```

**Response**:
- ✅ Query is detected as renewable
- ✅ Routed to renewable proxy agent
- ✅ **Real AgentCore analysis** (Python agents)
- ✅ Actual USGS elevation data
- ✅ Real exclusion zone identification
- ✅ Calculated suitability score
- ✅ Interactive Folium maps with real tiles
- ✅ Detailed thought steps from agents

**Browser Console**:
```
✅ RenewableClient: Connected to renewable energy service
✅ RenewableProxyAgent: Query processed successfully
```

### Real Data Example

```json
{
  "message": "Terrain analysis completed. Site shows excellent potential for wind farm development with 87.3% suitability score.",
  "artifacts": [{

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

```bash
# Run automated deployment
python scripts/deploy-renewable-backend-automated.py

# Follow prompts to complete AgentCore deployment
cd agentic-ai-for-renewable-site-design-mainline/workshop-assets/
jupyter notebook lab3_agentcore_tutorial.ipynb

# Update configuration
# Edit .env.local with endpoint URL

# Validate
./scripts/validate-renewable-integration.sh

# Deploy
npx ampx sandbox
npm run dev
```

**Time**: ~30 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Documentation**: [DEPLOY_RENEWABLE_BACKEND_NOW.md](./DEPLOY_RENEWABLE_BACKEND_NOW.md)

### Option 2: Manual

Follow the detailed manual deployment guide in [RENEWABLE_DEPLOYMENT.md](./RENEWABLE_DEPLOYMENT.md).

**Time**: ~45 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Best For**: Understanding the deployment process

## Why This Approach?

### Frontend-First Development

We built the complete integration layer before deploying the backend because:

1. **Parallel Development**: Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously
2. **Early Testing**: UI can be tested and refined without backend
3. **Clear Contracts**: API contracts defined upfront
4. **Faster Iteration**: UI changes don't require backend redeployment
5. **Mock Data**: Allows development to proceed while backend is being built

This is a **best practice** in modern web development.

### Benefits

- ✅ Frontend is 100% complete and tested
- ✅ Integration layer is production-ready
- ✅ UI components are polished
- ✅ Error handling is robust
- ✅ Documentation is comprehensive

### Trade-off

- ⚠️  Backend deployment is a separate step
- ⚠️  Requires AWS Bedrock AgentCore access
- ⚠️  Takes ~30 minutes to deploy

- [ ] Mock data is being used
- [ ] Console shows "Using mock response"
- [ ] Response time < 1 second
- [ ] Generic thought steps
- [ ] Suitability score always 85%

### After Deployment

- [ ] Real data is being used
- [ ] Console shows "Connected to renewable energy service"
- [ ] Response time 10-30 seconds
- [ ] Detailed thought steps from Python agents
- [ ] Suitability score varies by location
- [ ] Interactive maps with real USGS tiles
- [ ] Specific exclusion zones for each site

## Cost Estimate

### Development Environment

- **S3 Storage**: $0.023/GB/month (~$0.50/month)
- **Lambda**: $0.20 per 1M requests (~$1/month)
- **Bedrock AgentCore**: Preview pricing TBD (~$5-10/month estimated)
- **ECR**: $0.10/GB/month (~$0.50/month)

**Total**: ~$5-15/month for development

### Production Environment

Costs scale with usage:
- More queries = more Lambda invocations
- More artifacts = more S3 storage
- More agent calls = more Bedrock costs

**Estimated**: $20-100/month depending on usage
