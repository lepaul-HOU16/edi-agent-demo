# Amplify Gen 2 Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified
Your deployment is failing because this is an **Amplify Gen 2** project, but the `amplify.yml` build specification is using **Gen 1 CLI commands** that don't work with Gen 2 architecture.

**Error Details:**
- AppID `d1eeg2gu6ddc3z` exists and is valid
- Build fails on `amplifyPush --simple` command
- Gen 2 projects don't use traditional Amplify CLI commands

## Root Cause
- **Project Type**: Amplify Gen 2 (TypeScript-based backend in `amplify/` directory)
- **Current Build Config**: Using Gen 1 commands (`amplifyPush --simple`)
- **Required Fix**: Update `amplify.yml` to use Gen 2 deployment process

## Solution Applied
Updated `amplify.yml` to use the correct Gen 2 deployment commands:

### Backend Phase Changes:
- **Removed**: `amplifyPush --simple` 
- **Added**: `npx ampx generate outputs --app-id d1eeg2gu6ddc3z`

### Why This Works:
1. **Gen 2 Architecture**: Backend is defined in TypeScript (`amplify/backend.ts`)
2. **No CLI Push**: Gen 2 doesn't use `amplify push` - resources are deployed via CDK
3. **Outputs Generation**: `ampx generate outputs` creates the necessary `amplify_outputs.json`
4. **App ID Reference**: Uses the existing app ID to connect to deployed backend

## Next Steps After Fix
1. **Commit Changes**: The updated `amplify.yml` is now Gen 2 compatible
2. **Deploy**: Push to your connected Git branch to trigger deployment
3. **Monitor**: Watch the build logs to confirm successful deployment

## Gen 2 vs Gen 1 Differences
- **Gen 1**: Uses `.amplify/` directory and CLI commands
- **Gen 2**: Uses `amplify/` directory with TypeScript and CDK
- **Build Process**: Gen 2 generates outputs instead of pushing resources

Your project structure confirms this is Gen 2:
- ✅ `amplify/backend.ts` exists
- ✅ `amplify_outputs.json` exists  
- ❌ No `.amplify/` directory with CLI config

The fix ensures your deployment process matches your project architecture.
