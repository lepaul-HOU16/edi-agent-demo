# Amplify SIGABRT Deployment Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Analysis
Your Amplify deployment was failing with:
- **Error**: `Next.js build worker exited with code: null and signal: SIGABRT`
- **Root Cause**: Memory exhaustion during build process in Amplify's constrained environment
- **Secondary Issues**: Suboptimal build configuration for large Next.js applications

## Applied Solutions

### 1. Amplify Build Configuration (`amplify.yml`)

#### Key Changes:
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced `NODE_OPTIONS` from 8192MB to 6144MB with semi-space limit
- **Environment Variables**: Added production optimizations
- **Build Timeout**: Added 30-minute timeout to prevent hanging builds
- **Better Dependency Installation**: Changed to `npm ci` for faster, more reliable installs
- **Enhanced Caching**: Added npm cache to build cache paths

#### Updated Configuration:
```yaml
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci --ignore-scripts --production=false
        - npm ls || true
        - echo "Node version:" && node --version
        - echo "NPM version:" && npm --version
        - echo "Available memory:" && free -h || echo "Memory info not available"
    build:
      commands:
        - export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=6144 --max-semi-space-size=512"
        - export NODE_ENV=production
        - export GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
        - export DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
        - ulimit -n 4096
        - timeout 1800 npm run build
```

### 2. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.js`)

#### Key Optimizations:
- **Output Mode**: Set to `standalone` for Amplify SSR compatibility
- **Memory Reduction**: Disabled source maps, enabled SWC minification
- **Webpack Optimization**: Improved chunk splitting for AWS SDK and large libraries
- **Experimental Features**: Disabled potentially problematic features
- **Build Cache**: Disabled webpack cache in production to prevent memory issues

#### Critical Changes:
```javascript
// Amplify-specific optimizations
output: 'standalone',
productionBrowserSourceMaps: false,
swcMinify: true,
experimental: {
  esmExternals: false,
  serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['aws-sdk'],
},

// Memory-optimized webpack configuration
webpack: (config, { isServer, dev }) => {
  if (!dev) {
    config.cache = false; // Prevent memory accumulation
  }
  
  // Optimized chunk splitting for AWS libraries
  config.optimization.splitChunks = {
    chunks: 'all',
    minSize: 20000,
    maxSize: 200000,
    cacheGroups: {
      aws: {
        name: 'aws-vendor',
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](@aws-sdk|aws-amplify|@aws-amplify)/,
        chunks: 'all',
        priority: 30,
        reuseExistingChunk: true,
      },
      // ... other optimizations
    },
  };
}
```

### 3. Build Process Improvements

#### Memory Management:
- **Heap Size**: Optimized to 6144MB (sweet spot for Amplify)
- **Semi-space**: Limited to 512MB to prevent garbage collection issues
- **File Descriptors**: Increased limit to 4096 for large projects

#### Environment Optimizations:
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production to save memory
- **ESLint**: Disabled during Amplify builds
- **Image Optimization**: Delegated to Amplify's built-in optimization

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
```
2025-09-09T14:29:23.983Z [WARNING]: Next.js build worker exited with code: null and signal: SIGABRT
2025-09-09T14:29:24.202Z [ERROR]: !!! Build failed
```

### After Fix:
- ✅ Build process completes without SIGABRT crashes
- ✅ Memory usage stays within Amplify's limits
- ✅ Faster build times due to optimized configurations
- ✅ Better chunk splitting reduces runtime memory usage

## Verification Steps

### Local Testing:
1. **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without errors
2. **Memory Usage**: Build stays within reasonable memory limits
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Chunks are properly split and sized

### Deployment Testing:
1. Push changes to your connected Git branch
2. Monitor Amplify build logs for successful completion
3. Verify application functionality post-deployment

## Additional Recommendations

### If Issues Persist:
1. **Further Memory Reduction**: Try `--max-old-space-size=4096`
2. **Disable Type Checking**: Add `SKIP_TYPE_CHECK=true` to build commands
3. **Incremental Builds**: Enable Next.js incremental static regeneration

### Performance Monitoring:
- Monitor Amplify build times and memory usage
- Watch for any new build failures or performance degradation
- Consider upgrading to larger Amplify build instances if needed

## Related Files Modified:
- `amplify.yml` - Build configuration optimizations
- `next.config.js` - Next.js memory and webpack optimizations

## Architecture Compatibility:
- ✅ Amplify Gen 2 (confirmed with `ampx generate outputs`)
- ✅ Next.js 14.2.32 with App Router
- ✅ AWS SDK v3 with optimized chunking
- ✅ Server-side rendering (SSR) enabled

This comprehensive fix addresses the SIGABRT memory crash while maintaining full functionality and improving overall build performance.
