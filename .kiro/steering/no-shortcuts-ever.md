# NO SHORTCUTS. PROPER IMPLEMENTATION. DONE RIGHT.

## Core Principle

NEVER take shortcuts to "save time" or "get things working quickly."

The demo is already past. Time pressure is NOT an excuse for poor implementation.

## Rules

1. **Implement requirements as specified** - No workarounds, no "simpler alternatives"
2. **Use proper patterns** - If the spec says use matplotlib, use matplotlib
3. **Fix root causes** - Don't create fallbacks when the real solution is available
4. **No time-based decisions** - Never say "to get this working quickly" or "since time is limited"
5. **Quality over speed** - Proper implementation is the only acceptable outcome

## What This Means

- If matplotlib is required, ensure matplotlib is available (Docker, layers, etc.)
- If a specific pattern is specified, use that exact pattern
- If dependencies are missing, install them properly
- If deployment method is wrong, fix the deployment method

## What NOT To Do

- ❌ Create "simple" alternatives when the real solution exists
- ❌ Make workarounds instead of fixing root causes
- ❌ Skip proper deployment methods to "save time"
- ❌ Implement fallbacks when the primary solution should work
- ❌ Justify shortcuts with time pressure

## Remember

The user's demo is already past. There is no time pressure. Do it right.

**NO SHORTCUTS. PROPER IMPLEMENTATION. DONE RIGHT.**
