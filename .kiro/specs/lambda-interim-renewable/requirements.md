# Requirements Document - Lambda-Based Interim Renewable Solution

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for a simplified Lambda-based renewable energy solution that can work TODAY without waiting for AWS Bedrock AgentCore to reach GA. Instead of deploying the full multi-agent AgentCore system, we'll implement lightweight Lambda functions that provide renewable energy analysis using direct Bedrock API calls and simplified logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Direct Lambda Implementation (No AgentCore Dependency)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy renewable energy features immediately without waiting for AgentCore GA, so that users can start analyzing wind farm sites today.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing renewable features THEN they SHALL use standard AWS Lambda functions (not AgentCore runtime)
2. WHEN calling AI models THEN they SHALL use AWS Bedrock API directly (not AgentCore SDK)
3. WHEN processing queries THEN they SHALL use simple orchestration logic in Lambda (not multi-agent framework)
4. WHEN the solution is deployed THEN it SHALL work with current AWS services (Lambda, Bedrock, S3)
5. WHEN AgentCore becomes GA THEN the Lambda implementation SHALL be easily replaceable with the full AgentCore solution

### Requirement 2: Real Data from Renewable Demo Tools

**User Story:** As a user, I want to get REAL wind farm analysis data using the actual renewable demo tools, so that I get accurate, production-quality results while waiting for AgentCore GA.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing terrain THEN Lambda SHALL call the renewable demo's actual terrain analysis Python code with real GIS data
2. WHEN creating layouts THEN Lambda SHALL call the renewable demo's actual layout optimization algorithms
3. WHEN running simulations THEN Lambda SHALL call the renewable demo's actual py-wake simulation engine
4. WHEN generating reports THEN Lambda SHALL use the renewable demo's actual report generation logic
5. WHEN visualizations are needed THEN Lambda SHALL use the renewable demo's actual Folium/matplotlib visualization code
6. WHEN NREL wind data is needed THEN Lambda SHALL fetch real wind resource data from NREL APIs
7. WHEN terrain data is needed THEN Lambda SHALL fetch real elevation/land use data from USGS/OpenStreetMap
8. WHEN turbine specs are needed THEN Lambda SHALL use real turbine specifications from the demo's database

### Requirement 3: Direct Integration with Renewable Demo Python Tools

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to directly integrate the renewable demo's Python tools into Lambda functions, so that we get the exact same quality and accuracy as the full AgentCore solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing terrain analysis THEN it SHALL import and call the demo's `terrain_analysis.py` functions directly
2. WHEN implementing layout optimization THEN it SHALL import and call the demo's `layout_optimization.py` functions directly
3. WHEN implementing wake calculations THEN it SHALL import and call the demo's py-wake integration directly
4. WHEN generating visualizations THEN it SHALL import and call the demo's `visualization_utils.py` functions directly
5. WHEN Python tools are integrated THEN they SHALL be packaged into Lambda layers for reuse across functions
6. WHEN the demo code is updated THEN Lambda layers SHALL be rebuildable from the latest demo code

### Requirement 4: Simple Orchestration Instead of Multi-Agent Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple orchestration logic that replaces the complex multi-agent framework, so that we can deploy immediately without AgentCore.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a renewable query arrives THEN a TypeScript orchestrator Lambda SHALL determine which renewable demo tool to call
2. WHEN calling Python tools THEN the orchestrator SHALL invoke Python Lambda functions that wrap the demo's actual tools
3. WHEN responses are received THEN the orchestrator SHALL aggregate REAL results from the demo tools
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the orchestrator SHALL handle them gracefully and return user-friendly messages
5. WHEN the workflow is complete THEN REAL data and visualizations SHALL be returned in EDI Platform artifact format
6. WHEN compared to AgentCore THEN the Lambda orchestrator provides the same tools but simpler agent coordination

### Requirement 5: Minimal External Dependencies

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want minimal external dependencies, so that deployment is fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying Lambda functions THEN they SHALL use standard AWS SDK (no custom frameworks)
2. WHEN using Python libraries THEN they SHALL be limited to: boto3, pandas, numpy, folium, matplotlib, py-wake
3. WHEN using TypeScript libraries THEN they SHALL be limited to: @aws-sdk/*, existing EDI Platform dependencies
4. WHEN packaging Lambda functions THEN they SHALL use Lambda layers for shared dependencies
5. WHEN deploying THEN the entire solution SHALL deploy in < 5 minutes

### Requirement 6: Graceful Degradation and Mock Data

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work even when external services are unavailable, so that I can always get some results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN NREL wind data API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use reasonable default wind speeds
2. WHEN terrain data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use simplified terrain assumptions
3. WHEN visualization generation fails THEN the system SHALL return text-based results
4. WHEN Bedrock API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return cached or template responses
5. WHEN any component fails THEN the user SHALL receive a clear explanation and partial results if available

### Requirement 7: Easy Migration Path to AgentCore

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear migration path to AgentCore, so that when it becomes GA we can upgrade smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AgentCore becomes GA THEN the Lambda orchestrator SHALL be replaceable with AgentCore proxy
2. WHEN migrating THEN the artifact format SHALL remain the same (no UI changes needed)
3. WHEN migrating THEN the Python tool functions SHALL be reusable in AgentCore agents
4. WHEN migrating THEN the TypeScript client SHALL only need endpoint URL changes
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN users SHALL see improved multi-agent orchestration without breaking changes

### Requirement 8: Cost-Effective Implementation

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want a cost-effective interim solution, so that we don't overspend while waiting for AgentCore.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN they SHALL complete in < 30 seconds (minimize Lambda costs)
2. WHEN calling Bedrock THEN they SHALL use efficient prompts (minimize token usage)
3. WHEN storing artifacts THEN they SHALL use S3 (not expensive database storage)
4. WHEN caching is possible THEN results SHALL be cached to reduce repeated API calls
5. WHEN the solution is deployed THEN monthly costs SHALL be < $50 for typical usage

### Requirement 9: Maintain Existing EDI Platform Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want renewable features to work seamlessly with existing EDI Platform features, so that I have a unified experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN typing renewable queries THEN they SHALL be detected by the existing agent router
2. WHEN renewable analysis completes THEN artifacts SHALL display in the existing chat interface
3. WHEN switching between petrophysical and renewable queries THEN the transition SHALL be seamless
4. WHEN authentication is needed THEN it SHALL use the existing Cognito user pool
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently with other EDI Platform features

### Requirement 10: Clear Documentation and Examples

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on the Lambda-based implementation, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN architecture documentation SHALL explain the Lambda-based approach
2. WHEN deploying THEN step-by-step deployment instructions SHALL be provided
3. WHEN testing THEN example queries and expected results SHALL be documented
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be documented
5. WHEN migrating to AgentCore THEN migration instructions SHALL be provided

## Success Criteria

The Lambda-based interim solution will be considered successful when:

1. Users can analyze wind farm sites using renewable queries in the chat interface
2. The solution works TODAY without waiting for AgentCore GA
3. Lambda functions execute in < 30 seconds with reasonable accuracy
4. Python code from the renewable demo is reused where beneficial
5. TypeScript orchestration is simple and maintainable (< 300 lines)
6. External dependencies are minimal (standard AWS SDK + scientific libraries)
7. The system gracefully handles failures and provides partial results
8. A clear migration path to AgentCore exists
9. Monthly costs are < $50 for typical usage
10. Documentation is complete and examples are provided

## Non-Requirements

This interim solution explicitly does NOT require:

1. Full multi-agent orchestration (simplified single-agent approach is acceptable)
2. AgentCore runtime deployment
3. Complex agent frameworks (Strands, LangGraph, etc.)
4. Real-time streaming responses (batch responses are acceptable)
5. Advanced optimization algorithms (simple heuristics are acceptable)
6. Production-grade accuracy (reasonable estimates are acceptable for interim solution)
