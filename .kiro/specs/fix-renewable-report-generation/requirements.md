# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "generate executive report" functionality in the renewable energy system is currently not working. Users are unable to generate executive reports for wind farm projects, which is a critical feature for project documentation and stakeholder communication. The issue appears to be related to the deployment and configuration of the renewable energy Lambda tools, specifically the report generation tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user working on wind farm projects, I want to generate executive reports so that I can document project findings and share them with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests "Generate executive report" THEN the system SHALL successfully invoke the report generation tool
2. WHEN the report generation tool is called THEN it SHALL return a properly formatted HTML report
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include executive summary, recommendations, and next steps
4. WHEN the report generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the report generation to work with existing project data so that reports include relevant analysis results from previous steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terrain analysis data exists THEN the report SHALL include terrain analysis findings
2. WHEN layout optimization data exists THEN the report SHALL include turbine layout information
3. WHEN simulation results exist THEN the report SHALL include performance metrics and projections
4. WHEN no previous data exists THEN the report SHALL generate a basic project template with placeholder content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error handling and diagnostics so that I can troubleshoot report generation issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the report Lambda function is not deployed THEN the system SHALL return a clear deployment error message
2. WHEN the Lambda function exists but fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL indicate which configuration is missing
4. WHEN the function times out THEN the system SHALL provide timeout-specific error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the report generation to be fast and reliable so that I can quickly generate documentation for my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a report is requested THEN it SHALL be generated within 30 seconds
2. WHEN the system is under load THEN report generation SHALL still complete successfully
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL be properly formatted and displayable in the UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper deployment validation so that I can ensure the renewable energy tools are correctly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate that all renewable energy Lambda functions are deployed
2. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL verify they point to valid resources
3. WHEN deployment validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps
4. WHEN all tools are properly deployed THEN the system SHALL enable renewable energy functionality
