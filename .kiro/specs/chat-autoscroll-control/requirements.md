# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to improve the auto-scroll behavior in the EDI Platform chat sessions. Currently, the chat interface auto-scrolls in various scenarios which can be disruptive to the user experience. The goal is to implement precise control over when auto-scroll occurs, limiting it to only when new AI responses appear for the first time, while completely disabling it during page reloads and other scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user reading through chat history, I want auto-scroll to be completely disabled during page reloads so that I can maintain my reading position without being forced to the bottom of the chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reloads a chat session page THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically scroll to the bottom
2. WHEN a user navigates to an existing chat session THEN the system SHALL preserve the user's last scroll position or default to a neutral position
3. WHEN a user switches between chat sessions THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger auto-scroll in the destination session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user engaging in an active conversation, I want auto-scroll to only occur when a new AI response appears for the first time so that I can follow the conversation naturally without unwanted scrolling interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI agent starts generating a new response THEN the system SHALL enable auto-scroll for that specific response
2. WHEN an AI response is being streamed/updated THEN the system SHALL continue auto-scrolling to follow the growing content
3. WHEN an AI response is complete THEN the system SHALL disable auto-scroll until the next new response begins
4. WHEN a user manually scrolls during an active AI response THEN the system SHALL immediately disable auto-scroll for that response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user reviewing chat history, I want complete control over scrolling so that I can read previous messages without being interrupted by automatic scrolling behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is scrolled up in the chat history THEN the system SHALL NOT auto-scroll for any reason
2. WHEN a user manually scrolls to any position THEN the system SHALL respect that position and not override it
3. WHEN thinking indicators or loading states appear THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger auto-scroll
4. WHEN message components re-render or update THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger auto-scroll

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who wants to return to the latest messages, I want a manual control to scroll to the bottom so that I can choose when to return to the current conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not at the bottom of the chat THEN the system SHALL show a "scroll to bottom" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "scroll to bottom" button THEN the system SHALL smoothly scroll to the bottom
3. WHEN a user uses the "scroll to bottom" button THEN the system SHALL re-enable auto-scroll for new responses
4. WHEN a user is at the bottom of the chat THEN the system SHALL hide the "scroll to bottom" button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user working with chain-of-thought displays, I want the same controlled auto-scroll behavior so that I can review thinking steps without unwanted scrolling interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN chain-of-thought content is displayed THEN the system SHALL apply the same auto-scroll rules as the main chat
2. WHEN new thinking steps appear THEN the system SHALL only auto-scroll if it's a new AI response in progress
3. WHEN a user scrolls in the chain-of-thought panel THEN the system SHALL disable auto-scroll for that panel
4. WHEN chain-of-thought content loads on page reload THEN the system SHALL NOT auto-scroll

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the chat system, I want clear state management for auto-scroll behavior so that the system is predictable and debuggable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-scroll state changes THEN the system SHALL log the reason for the change
2. WHEN a new message begins THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between new responses and existing content
3. WHEN auto-scroll is disabled THEN the system SHALL maintain that state until explicitly re-enabled
4. WHEN debugging auto-scroll issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear console logs indicating the current state and triggers
