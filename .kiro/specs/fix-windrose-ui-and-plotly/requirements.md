# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses two UI/UX issues with the wind rose visualization:
1. The "Export Data" button and badges need to be repositioned to the top right corner with proper spacing
2. The Plotly interactive wind rose is not displaying despite being generated by the backend - the matplotlib PNG fallback is showing instead

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Export Button Positioning

**User Story:** As a user viewing wind rose analysis, I want the export button and status badges to be positioned in the top right corner so they don't interfere with the title text and provide a consistent UI pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a wind rose artifact THEN the "Export Data" button SHALL appear in the top right corner of the container header
2. WHEN the title text is long THEN it SHALL wrap with a 20px margin before reaching the buttons
3. WHEN status badges are present THEN they SHALL appear inline with the Export button in the top right
4. WHEN multiple action elements exist THEN they SHALL be grouped with consistent spacing (xs)

### Requirement 2: Plotly Wind Rose Display

**User Story:** As a user requesting wind rose analysis, I want to see the rich interactive Plotly visualization instead of the static matplotlib PNG so I can interact with the data and get detailed hover information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend generates Plotly wind rose data THEN the orchestrator SHALL pass through the `plotlyWindRose` field to the frontend
2. WHEN the frontend receives `plotlyWindRose` data THEN it SHALL render the PlotlyWindRose component instead of the matplotlib PNG
3. WHEN Plotly data is available THEN the component SHALL display the interactive polar bar chart with stacked bars
4. WHEN Plotly data is not available THEN the component SHALL fall back to the matplotlib PNG if present
5. WHEN neither Plotly nor matplotlib data is available THEN the component SHALL display the SVG fallback visualization
