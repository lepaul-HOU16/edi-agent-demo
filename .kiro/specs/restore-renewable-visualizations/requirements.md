# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current renewable energy system is missing many of the rich visualizations that were available in the original demo. Users expect to see comprehensive scientific visualizations including folium maps, wind rose diagrams, matplotlib charts, wake analysis plots, and other professional-grade visualizations that are standard in renewable energy analysis tools. The current implementation shows basic placeholder content instead of the sophisticated visualizations from the original workshop materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a renewable energy analyst, I want to see rich folium-based interactive maps so that I can properly analyze terrain features, turbine layouts, and site characteristics with professional mapping tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terrain analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL display interactive folium maps with multiple tile layers (satellite, topo, street)
2. WHEN turbine layouts are generated THEN the system SHALL show folium maps with turbine markers and layout overlays
3. WHEN maps are displayed THEN they SHALL include proper styling, popups, and interactive controls matching the original demo
4. WHEN multiple data layers exist THEN the system SHALL provide layer controls to toggle between different visualizations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a wind energy engineer, I want to see wind rose diagrams and meteorological visualizations so that I can understand wind patterns and optimize turbine placement accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wind resource analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL generate wind rose diagrams showing directional wind patterns
2. WHEN wind data is available THEN the system SHALL display wind speed distributions and frequency charts
3. WHEN seasonal analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL show monthly/seasonal wind pattern variations
4. WHEN wind roses are displayed THEN they SHALL use professional color schemes and include proper legends

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project developer, I want to see comprehensive wake analysis visualizations so that I can understand energy losses and optimize wind farm performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wake simulation is performed THEN the system SHALL display wake deficit maps showing energy loss patterns
2. WHEN turbine performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL show individual turbine production charts
3. WHEN wake effects are calculated THEN the system SHALL display wake visualization overlays on site maps
4. WHEN performance metrics are generated THEN they SHALL include interactive charts and heat maps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a renewable energy consultant, I want to see matplotlib-based scientific charts and plots so that I can analyze data with publication-quality visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL generate matplotlib charts with professional styling
2. WHEN performance data is available THEN the system SHALL create line plots, scatter plots, and distribution charts
3. WHEN comparative analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL display multi-series charts with proper legends
4. WHEN charts are exported THEN they SHALL maintain high resolution and professional formatting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site assessment engineer, I want to see terrain elevation profiles and topographic visualizations so that I can evaluate site suitability and access requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terrain analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL display elevation contour maps
2. WHEN site profiles are requested THEN the system SHALL show cross-sectional elevation profiles
3. WHEN slope analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL display slope gradient visualizations
4. WHEN accessibility is evaluated THEN the system SHALL show road networks and access route analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the visualization system to use the same libraries and approaches as the original demo so that we maintain consistency and leverage existing proven code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visualizations are generated THEN the system SHALL use folium for interactive maps
2. WHEN scientific plots are created THEN the system SHALL use matplotlib for chart generation
3. WHEN data processing is performed THEN the system SHALL use pandas and numpy for data manipulation
4. WHEN visualization utilities are needed THEN the system SHALL leverage the existing visualization_utils.py functions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want visualizations to be properly integrated into the EDI Platform interface so that they display seamlessly within the existing UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN folium maps are generated THEN they SHALL be properly embedded in React components via iframe or HTML rendering
2. WHEN matplotlib charts are created THEN they SHALL be converted to images or interactive formats for web display
3. WHEN visualizations are large THEN they SHALL be properly sized and responsive within the UI
4. WHEN multiple visualizations exist THEN they SHALL be organized in tabs or expandable sections for better UX
