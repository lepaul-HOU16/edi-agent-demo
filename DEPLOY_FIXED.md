# ✅ Architecture Issue Fixed - Ready to Deploy

## What Was Wrong

The Docker image was built for the wrong architecture. Lambda requires:
- **x86_64** (amd64) - Standard Lambda architecture
- **ARM64** (arm64) - Graviton2 processors (optional)

The previous build didn't specify a platform, causing a manifest mismatch.

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ **Updated build command** to use `--platform linux/amd64`
2. ✅ **Changed Lambda architecture** from `arm64` to `x86_64`
3. ✅ **Deleted old image** from ECR
4. ✅ **Deleted failed Lambda function** (if it existed)

## Deploy Now

Run the deployment again:

```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-complete-system.py
```

Or with the interactive script:

```bash
./scripts/quick-deploy.sh
```

## What Will Happen

The Docker build will now include:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <image> .
```

This ensures the image is compatible with Lambda's x86_64 architecture.

## Expected Output

```
🔨 Building Docker image for x86_64 platform...
[Building...]
⬆️  Pushing image to ECR...
✅ Image pushed: ...
✅ Created Lambda function
```

## If It Still Fails

Check:
1. Docker supports multi-platform builds: `docker buildx version`
2. The base image is accessible: `docker pull public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12`
3. ECR repository exists: `aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-names agentcore-gateway-lambda-container`

## Ready?

```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-complete-system.py
```

Let's deploy! 🚀
