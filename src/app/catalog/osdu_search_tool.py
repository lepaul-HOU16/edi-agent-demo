        # Query

        Parameters
        query 	The Query string is based on Lucene query string syntax, supplemented with a specific format for describing queries to fields of object arrays indexed with the nested hint. The maximum number of clauses on a query can be 1024.

        Important: Field names in request parameters are case-sensitive. Field values are case-insensitive, unless you are querying for an exact match with a keyword subfield for the attribute.
        Note: The Offset + Limit can not be more than 10,000. See the Query with cursor topic for more efficient ways to do deep scrolling.


        ## Text queries
        The OSDU Data Platform provides comprehensive query options in Lucene query syntax. The query string is parsed into a series of terms and operators. A term can be a single word, such as "producing" or "well", or a phrase, surrounded by double quotes, such as "producing well", which searches for all the words in the phrase, in the same order. The default operator for the query is OR.
        You can search a field in the document <field-name>:<value>. If field is not defined, then it defaults to all queryable fields, and the query will automatically attempt to determine the existing fields in the index's mapping that are queryable, and perform the search on those fields.
        The query language is quite comprehensive and can be intimidating at first glance, but the best way to actually learn it is to start with a few basic examples.
        Note: kind is a required parameter and is omitted for brevity in following examples. Also, all storage record properties are in data block. Any reference to a field inside the block should be prefixed with data.

        ### Examples
        Search all fields that contain the text 'well':
        {
        "query": "well"
        }

        Note: If <field-name> is not specified, the query string will automatically attempt to determine the existing fields in the index's mapping that are queryable, and perform the search on those fields. The search query will be more performant if field names are specified in the query instead of searching across all queryable attributes. The following examples cover this:

        Where the Basin field contains "Permian":
        {
        "query": "data.Basin:Permian"
        }

        Where the Rig_Contractor field contains "Ocean" or "Drilling". OR is the default operator:
        {
        "query": "data.Rig_Contractor:(Ocean OR Drilling)"
        }
        or
        {
        "query": "data.Rig_Contractor:(Ocean Drilling)"
        }

        Where the Rig_Contractor field contains the exact phrase "Ocean Drilling":
        {
        "query": "data.Rig_Contractor:\"Ocean Drilling\""
        }

        The Search service offers additional query patterns to query precise values. For details see exact match.
        Where any of the fields ValueList.OriginalValue, ValueList.Value, or ValueList.AppDataType contains "PRODUCING" or "DUAINE". (Note that you need to escape the * with a backslash.)
        {
        "query": "data.ValueList.\\*:(PRODUCING DUAINE)"
        }

        text field indexing
        By default, search back-end server analyzes the values of text fields & text array fields (including text fields with nested x-osdu-indexing hints) during indexing. The Indexer service analyzer changes text field values as follows:
        Removes most punctuation & prepositions.
        Divides the remaining content into individual words, called tokens.
        Changes the tokens to lowercase.

        To better support a precise exact match, aggregation & sort on text field, an additional field is indexed (on kinds indexed after April 2021) for every text field, that is not analyzed (as per rules mentioned above). As an example, if record has a text field named data.name, then the indexer will add the non-analyzed field: data.name.keyword. Newly added text fields can be identified as: field-name.keyword. Also installations with keywordLower feature flag enabled have additional keywordLower field, allowing case agnostic precise search.
        Note 1: The keyword and keywordLower field value can have a maximum of 256 characters, and only exact match is supported for this field, so a partial field value query will not return any response. If a text field is longer than 256 characters, then both keyword and keywordLower fields will have only the first 256 characters.
        Note 2: text array fields indexed with flattened indexing hint are non-analyzed during indexing by default and do not require keyword subfield. Exact match, aggregations and sort queries on such fields do not require keyword suffix.

        ## Exact match
        Use the exact match query to search records based on a precise value using keyword subfield mentioned here, such as well ID, name, etc. on text fields.
        As indexed keyword subfield is not analyzed, query on this field is case sensitive & no escaping is required for special characters covered in the reserved characters section.

        Here is an example query, it two special characters, space and period, without any escaping:
        {
            "query": "data.name.keyword:\"Spillpath DA no.109\""
        }

        The keywordLower (OSDU Data Platform deployment with keywordLower feature enabled) subfield has only one difference - it is allowing non-case sensitive search. Example:
        {
            "query": "data.name.keywordLower:\"spillpath da no.109\""
        }

        ## Query null or empty values
        text field's keyword subfield can also be utilized to query records by null or empty value on text attributes. null value search/index workflows are only supported on text fields.

        Here is a sample query to search null value:
        {
        "query": "data.FacilityID.keyword:null"
        }

        Here is an example query to search empty value:
        {
        "query": "data.FacilityID.keyword:\"\""
        }

        ## Exists query
        Returns documents that contain an indexed value for a field. Use the _exists_ prefix for a field to search to see if the field exists.
        While a text field is deemed non-existent if the JSON value is null, following values will indicate the field does exist:
        Empty strings, such as "".
        keyword subfield with explicit null value.
        Similarly text array field considered non-existent if the JSON value is null or [], text arrays containing null and another value , such as [null, "abc"] indicates the field does exist.

        Example request:
        Where query returns if the text field Status has any non-null value.
        {
        "query": "_exists_:data.Status"
        }

        ## Reserved characters
        If you need to use any of the characters which function as operators in your query itself (and not as operators), then you must escape them with a leading backslash. 
        The reserved characters are: + - = && || > < ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \\ /
        Failing to escape these special characters correctly could lead to a syntax error which prevents your query from running.
        Note: < and > can't be escaped at all. The only way to prevent them from attempting to create a range query is to remove them from the query string entirely.
        Wildcards
        Wildcard searches can be run on individual terms using ? to replace a single character and * to replace zero or more characters.
        {
        "query": "data.Rig_Contractor:Oc?an Dr*"
        }
        Be aware that wildcard queries can use an enormous amount of memory and therefore can effect the performance. They should be used very sparingly.
        Note: Leading wildcards are disabled by the OSDU Data Platform Search service. Allowing a wildcard at the beginning of a word, such as "*ean", is particularly heavy because all the terms in the index need to be examined, just in case they match.

        ## Grouping
        Multiple terms or clauses can be grouped together with parentheses to form sub-queries.
        {
        "query": "data.Rig_Contractor:(Ocean OR Drilling) AND Exploration NOT Basin"
        }


        ## Query nested arrays objects
        Starting with OSDU's M6 release, you can set nested hints in a data scheme's object array nodes. It leads to accurate indexing of those arrays objects in the underlying search backend.
        nested attributes can be queried using the Search service in the form of the nested() function:
        For one level "nested array":
        {
        "query": "nested(<path-to-root-nested-array-node>, <root-nested-array-object-fields-query>)"
        }

        For nested (multi-level) "nested array" queries:
        {
        "query": "nested(<path-to-root-nested-array-node>, nested(<path-to-subrootA-nested-array-node>, <subrootA-nested-array-object-fields-query>))"
        }

        Multi-level nested queries are not limited in their depth. You nest them as required by the particular schema.
        In the examples below, you can see several examples of the root and multi-level nested queries. The syntax of those queries is the same as described in the previous sections. The only distinction is that their conditions are scoped by their own fields of objects of the array, pointed in the first argument of the current nested(path,(conditions)) function.

        ### Single-level one condition nested query
        Where work-product-component--WellboreMarkerSet has any marker with MarkerMeasuredDepth field value greater than 10000:
        {
        "query": "nested(data.Markers, (MarkerMeasuredDepth:(>10000)))"
        }

        ### Single-level several conditions nested query
        Where work-product-component--WellboreMarkerSet has any marker with VerticalMeasurement field value greater than 100 and VerticalMeasurementPathID field value is osdu-openness:reference-data--VerticalMeasurementPath:ELEV::
        {
            "query": "nested(data.VerticalMeasurements, (VerticalMeasurement:(>100) AND VerticalMeasurementPathID:\"osdu-openness:reference-data--VerticalMeasurementPath:ELEV:\"))"
        }

        ### Combination of single-level nested queries
        Where work-product-component--WellboreMarkerSet has any marker with MarkerMeasuredDepth field value greater 10000 or SurfaceDipAzimuth field value less than 360:
        {
        "query":"nested(data.Markers, (MarkerMeasuredDepth:(>10000))) OR nested(data.Markers, (SurfaceDipAzimuth:(<360)))"
        }


        ### Nested and non-nested queries parts combinations
        We can combine both types of queries in one request, such as in the following example:

        {
        "query":"data.Name:\"Example Name\" AND nested(data.Markers, (MarkerMeasuredDepth:(>10000)))"
        }

        Geo-spatial queries
        The OSDU Data Platform supports geo-point (lat/lon pairs) & geo-shape based on GeoJson standard. The spatialFilter and query groups in the request have an AND relationship. If both of the criteria are defined in the query, then the Search service will return results which match both clauses.
        The queries in this group are Geo distance, Geo polygon, and Bounding box. Only one spatial criteria can be used while defining the filter.
        Note 1: Geo-spatial fields, which are indexed with GeoJSON FeatureCollection payload, in the Search service query response have a different structure compared to storage records and are optimized for search use-case. These are no valid GeoJSON. To retrieve a valid GeoJSON, use the Storage service's record API.
        Note 2: Search backend requires all geo-shape to be GeoJSON and OGC standard complaint. User may see indexing issues if geo-shapes are not complaint. Most common issue violating these standards are geo-shapes with duplicate coordinates or self-intersecting polygon etc. Once users have retrieved record level indexing status or error message via index status, they are expected to fix the geo-shape and re-try ingestion to address such issues.
        Geo distance query

        The frontend has a map where users can define boxes and polygons, which will
        be passed to you as an OSDU spatial filter.

        You need to acquire the main components of an OSDU search query by running the available tools.
        You also need to test that the search works and re-evaluate it if it fails.
        You have various tools available to you to complete the query.

        An OSDU query requires the following entries:
        - kind: the schemas to search.
        - query: the attributes to search from within the schemas.
        - aggregateBy: On which fields to aggregate the data for display purposes and user needs.
        - spatialFilter: a filter that limits the search to a bounding box or distance from a location.
        - returnedFields: specifies the fields on which to project the results.

        Chain of thought:
        - Find the schemas/kinds needed that has the correct data
        - Determine the fields in the schemas that need to be searched
        - Remove any schemas that do not have fields that are being used
        - Generate the query
        - Determine the aggregateBy field
        - Determine the spatialFilter field
        - Determine the returnedFields field
        - Test the query to make sure it works

        find_schema_search_fields: With the given schemas, it determines which fields/parameters within the schema you need to query to get the relevent data.  Also determines which parameters are nested or not.
        generate_query: Using the fields and schemas, generates an Apache Lucene OSDU query.
        determine_aggregation: Using the prompt and context, understands what the aggregateBy filter needs to be for the frontend.
        determine_returned_fields: Using the schema files selected, it determines which fields are most important for the frontend to display to the user in a table.
