# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - Final Step to Get Real Data

**Current Status**: Mock data confirmed in browser logs  
**Root Cause**: Backend not deployed - Lambda still has old code  
**Solution**: Run ONE command

---

## 🎯 The ONE Command You Need

```bash
./scripts/deploy-with-renewable-enabled.sh
```

**That's it!** This will:
1. Export environment variables
2. Deploy Lambda with new AWS SDK code
3. Takes 2-3 minutes
4. You'll get real data

---

## 📊 Evidence You're Still on Mock Data

From your browser logs:
```javascript
projectId: "mock-project-123"  // ← Mock!
mapHtml: "<div>Mock Folium Map - Terrain Analysis</div>"  // ← Mock!
coordinates: {lng: 0, lat: 0}  // ← Should be 35.067482, -101.395466!
```

---

## ✅ After Deployment

You'll see:
```javascript
projectId: "wind-farm-abc123"  // ← Real project ID
mapHtml: "<iframe src='...'>"  // ← Real Folium map
coordinates: {lng: -101.395466, lat: 35.067482}  // ← Your actual coordinates!
```

---

## 🔄 Full Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend (2-3 minutes)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-with-renewable-enabled.sh
```

Wait for "Deployment complete!" message.

### 2. Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Again
Open http://localhost:3000/chat and try:
```
Analyze wind farm potential at coordinates 35.067482, -101.395466
```

### 4. Verify Real Data
Check browser console - should see:
- Real coordinates (not 0, 0)
- Real project ID (not "mock-project-123")
- Real map HTML (not "Mock Folium Map")

## 🎯 Why This Will Work

**Current State**:
```
Local Code ✅ → Has AWS SDK integration
AWS Lambda ❌ → Still has old code (Sept 29)
```

**After Deployment**:
```
Local Code ✅ → Has AWS SDK integration
AWS Lambda ✅ → Has AWS SDK integration (deployed today)
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **00:00** - Run deployment script
- **00:30** - Amplify builds Lambda package
- **01:30** - Lambda uploads to AWS
- **02:30** - Deployment complete ✅
- **02:35** - Restart dev server
- **02:40** - Test with real data 🎉

---

## 🚨 Important

**Don't skip the deployment!** 

Code changes in your local files don't automatically deploy to AWS. You MUST run the deployment command for Lambda to get the new code.

---

**🚀 Run this now:**

```bash
./scripts/deploy-with-renewable-enabled.sh
```

Then wait 2-3 minutes and test again!
