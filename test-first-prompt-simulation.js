  // The problematic response that users are currently getting
  const problematicResponse = `I'd be happy to help you with your analysis! 

To get started, I need to know which well to analyze. Here's what you can do:

**Next steps:**
1. First, see available wells: "list wells" 
2. Then specify a well: "Analyze the complete dataset of 24 production wells from WELL-001 through WELL-024. Generate a comprehensive summary showing available log curves (GR, RHOB, NPHI, DTC, CALI, resistivity), spatial distribution, depth ranges, and data quality assessment. Create interactive visualizations showing field overview and well statistics. for [WELL_NAME]"

**Available analysis types:**
- Porosity calculations: "calculate porosity for WELL-001"
- Shale volume analysis: "calculate shale volume for WELL-001" 
- Formation evaluation: "analyze well data for WELL-001"

Would you like me to show you the available wells first?

💡 **What you can try:**
- "list wells" - to see available data
- "well info [WELL_NAME]" - to check a specific well
- "help" - for available commands`;

  // What users should get instead
  const improvedResponse = `Porosity Calculation

I can help you calculate porosity! Here are some available wells to choose from:

1. WELL-001
2. WELL-002  
3. WELL-003

To calculate porosity, please specify a well:
- "calculate porosity for WELL-001"
- "density porosity for WELL-002"
- "effective porosity for WELL-003"

Available methods: density, neutron, effective`;

  console.log('❌ PROBLEMATIC RESPONSE (what users currently see):');
  console.log('=' .repeat(80));
  console.log(problematicResponse);
  console.log('=' .repeat(80));
  
  console.log('\n✅ IMPROVED RESPONSE (what users should see):');
  console.log('=' .repeat(80));
  console.log(improvedResponse);
  console.log('=' .repeat(80));
  
  console.log('\n🔍 ANALYSIS OF THE PROBLEM:');
  console.log('1. The problematic response contains confusing template text');
  console.log('2. The second instruction is broken and contains placeholder text');
  console.log('3. Users get confused by the mixed instructions');
  console.log('4. The response doesn\'t provide clear, actionable next steps');
  
  console.log('\n💡 SOLUTION APPROACH:');
  console.log('1. Fix intent detection to handle missing well names gracefully');
  console.log('2. Update handlers to provide helpful well suggestions');
  console.log('3. Remove confusing template instructions');
  console.log('4. Ensure success=true for helpful guidance responses');
  
  console.log('\n🎯 TARGET: When users say "calculate porosity" without a well name,');
  console.log('   they should get helpful well suggestions, not confusing errors.');
