# 📊 Current Status & Next Steps

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: Integration code complete, but AgentCore connection needs verification

---

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_RENEWABLE_ENABLED=true`
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_RENEWABLE_AGENTCORE_ENDPOINT` set to ARN
- ✅ `RENEWABLE_PROXY_FUNCTION_NAME` set correctly

### 2. IAM Permissions
- ✅ TypeScript Lambda can invoke Python Lambda
- ✅ Python Lambda has bedrock-agentcore permissions (configured in backend.ts)

### 3. Python Lambda Code
- ✅ Deployed with python3.12 runtime
- ✅ Fixed `context.aws_request_id` bug
- ✅ Uses boto3 for bedrock-agentcore

### 4. Integration Layer
- ✅ RenewableClient detects ARN and calls Python proxy
- ✅ RenewableProxyAgent routes queries correctly
- ✅ Agent Router enables renewable features

---

## ❓ Remaining Question: Is AgentCore Runtime Actually Working?

The integration code is complete, but we're still seeing mock data. This could mean:

### Possibility 1: AgentCore Runtime Not Accessible
The ARN you have might not be accessible or might not exist:
```
arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:484907533441:agent-runtime/wind_farm_layout_agent-7DnHlIBg3o
```

### Possibility 2: AgentCore Permissions Issue
The Python Lambda might not have permission to call this specific AgentCore runtime.

### Possibility 3: AgentCore Runtime Not Deployed
The runtime might need to be deployed first using the Jupyter notebook.

---

## 🧪 Test the Integration

### Step 1: Send a New Query
Open http://localhost:3000/chat and try:
```
Analyze wind farm potential at coordinates 35.067482, -101.395466
```

### Step 2: Check Python Lambda Logs
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/amplify-digitalassistant--RenewableAgentCoreProxy6-Vv9NVowsUjd5 --follow
```

Look for one of these outcomes:

#### Success:
```
🌱 RenewableAgentCoreProxy: Received event
🌱 Calling AgentCore with prompt: Analyze wind farm...
🌱 Runtime ARN: arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:...
✅ AgentCore response received: 1234 chars
```

#### Permission Error:
```
❌ Error in AgentCore proxy: AccessDeniedException
```

#### Runtime Not Found:
```
❌ Error in AgentCore proxy: ResourceNotFoundException
```

#### Other Error:
```
❌ Error in AgentCore proxy: [error message]
```

---

## 🔍 Verify AgentCore Runtime

### Check if Runtime Exists:
```bash
aws bedrock-agentcore get-agent-runtime \
  --agent-runtime-id wind_farm_layout_agent-7DnHlIBg3o \
  --region us-east-1 2>&1
```

Expected outcomes:
- **Success**: Runtime details returned
- **Not Found**: `ResourceNotFoundException` - Runtime doesn't exist
- **No Permission**: `AccessDeniedException` - Need permissions
- **Service Not Available**: `UnknownOperationException` - bedrock-agentcore might not be available in CLI yet

---

## 📋 Next Steps Based on Test Results

### If Python Lambda Shows Success:
✅ **Real data integration is working!**
- The mock data might be from the response transformer
- Check the response structure

### If Python Lambda Shows Permission Error:
Need to add IAM permission to Python Lambda role:
```bash
ROLE_NAME=$(aws lambda get-function-configuration \
  --function-name amplify-digitalassistant--RenewableAgentCoreProxy6-Vv9NVowsUjd5 \
  --query 'Role' --output text | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')

aws iam put-role-policy \
  --role-name "$ROLE_NAME" \
  --policy-name InvokeAgentCore \
  --policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgentRuntime",
        "bedrock-agentcore:InvokeAgent"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-east-1:484907533441:agent-runtime/*"
    }]
  }'
```

### If Runtime Doesn't Exist:
Need to deploy AgentCore runtime using the Jupyter notebook:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (87% complete from previous session)
2. Run the remaining cells to deploy the runtime
3. Get the new runtime ARN
4. Update environment variables with new ARN

### If Service Not Available:
The bedrock-agentcore service might be in preview and not fully available. Consider:
1. Using the workshop deployment scripts directly
2. Deploying via the Jupyter notebook
3. Checking AWS region availability

---

## 🎯 Recommended Action

**Test now with a new query** and check the Python Lambda logs. The logs will tell us exactly what's happening:

```bash
# In one terminal, watch logs:
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/amplify-digitalassistant--RenewableAgentCoreProxy6-Vv9NVowsUjd5 --follow

# In browser, send query:
"Analyze wind farm potential at coordinates 35.067482, -101.395466"
```

The logs will show us:
- ✅ If AgentCore is being called successfully
- ❌ If there's a permission error
- ❌ If the runtime doesn't exist
- ❌ If there's another error

## Summary

**All integration code is complete and deployed.** The remaining question is whether the AgentCore runtime at the ARN you provided is actually accessible and working.

**Next step**: Send a new query and check the Python Lambda logs to see what's happening with the AgentCore call.

**🧪 Test command:**

```bash
# Watch logs in terminal:
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/amplify-digitalassistant--RenewableAgentCoreProxy6-Vv9NVowsUjd5 --follow

# Send query in browser:
"Analyze wind farm potential at coordinates 35.067482, -101.395466"
```

The logs will tell us exactly what needs to be fixed next.
