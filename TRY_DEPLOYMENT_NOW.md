# Try Deployment Now - Buildx Fixed

## What Changed

Updated the deployment to use `docker buildx build` which creates proper OCI-compliant manifests that Lambda accepts.

## Changes Made

1. âœ… **Using buildx** - `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push`
2. âœ… **Build and push in one step** - More reliable manifest handling
3. âœ… **Deleted old incompatible image** from ECR
4. âœ… **Tested buildx locally** - Confirmed it works

## Deploy Now

```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-complete-system.py
```

## What's Different

**Old command:**
```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t <image> .
docker push <image>
```

**New command:**
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push -t <image> .
```

The buildx command creates a proper multi-platform manifest that Lambda recognizes.

## Expected Output

```
ðŸ”¨ Building and pushing Docker image for x86_64 platform...
[Building...]
âœ… Image pushed: ...
âœ… Created Lambda function
```

## If It Still Fails

We may need to use the original workshop deployment method which uses the utilities from the workshop-assets directory. Those have been tested and work.

## Ready?

```bash
python3 scripts/deploy-complete-system.py
```
