# S3 Bucket Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The frontend was pointing to the wrong S3 bucket, preventing the auto context functionality from accessing the 24 .las files in the global directory.

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch between frontend and backend bucket configurations:
- **Backend (Lambda functions)**: `amplify-d1eeg2gu6ddc3z-ma-workshopstoragebucketd9b-lzf4vwokty7m` (Correct)
- **Frontend (amplify_outputs.json)**: `amplify-digitalassistant--workshopstoragebucketd9b-mx1aevbdpmqy` (Incorrect)

## Fix Applied
âœ… Updated `amplify_outputs.json` to use the correct bucket name:
- Changed `bucket_name` from `amplify-digitalassistant--workshopstoragebucketd9b-mx1aevbdpmqy` 
- To: `amplify-d1eeg2gu6ddc3z-ma-workshopstoragebucketd9b-lzf4vwokty7m`

## What Was Preserved
âœ… The auto context improvements for the 24 .las files were preserved because:
- The correct bucket fix was already implemented in the Lambda functions (commit `bc678aa`)
- The Lambda functions were already configured to scan the correct bucket
- Only the frontend configuration needed to be corrected

## Expected Result
ðŸŽ¯ The frontend should now be able to:
- Access the same S3 bucket that the Lambda functions use
- Display auto context information for all 24 .las files
- Show the proper global directory context in chat sessions

## Files Modified
1. `amplify_outputs.json` - Updated bucket configuration to match backend

## Verification Steps
To verify the fix works:
1. Start the application (`npm run dev`)
2. Navigate to a chat session
3. Ask the agent about available data files
4. The agent should now report finding 24+ .las files (not 0)

## Key Commit Reference
- **Friday Fix**: Commit `bc678aa` - "CRITICAL FIX: Correct S3 bucket for LAS file discovery"
- **This Fix**: Updated frontend to match the Friday backend fix

This approach preserved all auto context improvements while restoring the working state from Friday 9:30pm.
