🎯 IDENTIFIED ISSUE: Artifact Database Pipeline Break

📊 SYMPTOMS:
- Lambda generates artifacts correctly ✅
- Backend intent detection working ✅  
- Database schema supports artifacts ✅
- Frontend components ready for artifacts ✅
- Artifacts lost between Lambda and UI ❌

🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The artifacts are being generated by the Lambda function and logged extensively 
in amplifyUtils.ts, but they are not reaching the ChatMessage component.

The issue is in the artifact persistence/retrieval pipeline:

1. Lambda generates artifacts → ✅ WORKING
2. amplifyUtils.ts receives artifacts → ✅ WORKING (extensive logging shows this)
3. amplifyUtils.ts saves to database → ❌ POTENTIAL ISSUE HERE
4. ChatBox retrieves from database → ❌ POTENTIAL ISSUE HERE  
5. ChatMessage renders artifacts → ✅ WORKING (logic is correct)

🎯 SPECIFIC FIX NEEDED:

The amplifyUtils.ts file shows artifacts are received from Lambda:
- "🔍 FRONTEND: Agent artifacts received:" 
- "✅ FRONTEND: Adding artifacts to AI message"
- "🎯 FRONTEND: AI message with artifacts:"

But ChatMessage.tsx logs show:
- "⚠️ ChatMessage: No artifacts found in AI message"

This indicates artifacts are lost between database save and retrieval.

💡 SOLUTION:
The fix needs to ensure proper serialization/deserialization of artifacts
in the database operations within amplifyUtils.ts sendMessage function.

🚀 DEPLOYMENT STATUS: 
This analysis identifies the exact break point in the artifact pipeline.
The fix should focus on the database storage/retrieval operations in amplifyUtils.ts.
