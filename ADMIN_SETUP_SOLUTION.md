# OSDU Admin Setup Solution

## Problem Summary
- ✅ **Services Working**: API alignment fixed - all services now render correctly
- ❌ **Permissions Issue**: `cmgabri@amazon.com` lacks admin permissions to access OSDU services
- ❌ **Schema Access**: "No authority to list schemas" error
- ❌ **Group Management**: Can create entitlements but not groups
- 🎯 **Goal**: Full admin access to all OSDU services

## Root Cause
This is a classic OSDU bootstrap problem - you need admin groups and entitlements to access services, but you need access to create those groups. It's a chicken-and-egg situation.

## Solution Provided

### 1. 🔧 **Added Group Management Methods**
Enhanced `osduApiService.js` with:
- `createGroup()` - Create new groups
- `addGroupMember()` - Add members to groups

### 2. 📋 **Created Bootstrap Scripts**
- `setup-admin-entitlements.js` - Detailed setup guide
- `bootstrap-admin-groups.js` - Step-by-step instructions
- Both provide exact group names, emails, and descriptions

### 3. 🖥️ **Added Admin Bootstrap UI**
- `AdminBootstrap.tsx` - React component for creating admin groups
- Integrated into the API test page
- One-click admin group creation

### 4. 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Detailed setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guides
- Verification steps

## Required Admin Groups

You need to create these 6 admin groups with yourself as a member:

### Service Admin Groups
1. **service.schema.admin@osdu.dataservices.energy**
   - Full access to schema operations
   - Solves "no authority to list schemas" error

2. **service.storage.admin@osdu.dataservices.energy**
   - Full access to storage operations
   - Allows creating/reading all records

3. **service.search.admin@osdu.dataservices.energy**
   - Full access to search operations
   - Enables all search functionality

4. **service.legal.admin@osdu.dataservices.energy**
   - Full access to legal tag operations
   - Manage legal tags and compliance

5. **service.entitlements.admin@osdu.dataservices.energy**
   - Full access to entitlements and groups
   - Allows creating groups (solves your current issue)

### Data Access Groups
6. **data.default.owners@osdu.dataservices.energy**
   - Default data ownership permissions
   - Allows creating and managing data records

## Setup Options

### Option A: Use the UI Component (Recommended)
1. 🌐 Go to the API test page
2. 🔝 You'll see "OSDU Admin Bootstrap" at the top
3. 🖱️ Click "Bootstrap Admin Groups" button
4. ⏳ Wait for groups to be created
5. 🔄 Log out and back in to refresh tokens

### Option B: Manual Setup via Entitlements Page
1. 📋 Follow the detailed instructions in `bootstrap-admin-groups.js`
2. 🏗️ Create each group manually using the exact names/emails provided
3. 👤 Add `cmgabri@amazon.com` as a member to each group
4. 🔗 Create entitlements mapping groups to services

### Option C: Backend/Database Direct Access
If you have direct database access, you can insert the groups directly into the entitlements database.

## Verification Steps

After setup, test these in order:

1. **🔄 Refresh Authentication**
   - Log out and log back in
   - This refreshes your JWT tokens with new group memberships

2. **🧪 Test API Services**
   - Go to API test page
   - Try "Test All Services"
   - All services should work without permission errors

3. **📊 Test Schema Access**
   - Schema service should list schemas without "no authority" error

4. **👥 Test Group Creation**
   - Go to Entitlements page
   - You should now be able to create groups

5. **💾 Test Storage Operations**
   - Storage service should allow full CRUD operations

## Expected Results

After successful setup:

✅ **Schema Service**: List, create, update schemas
✅ **Storage Service**: Full CRUD operations on records  
✅ **Search Service**: All search operations
✅ **Legal Service**: Manage legal tags
✅ **Entitlements Service**: Create/manage groups and entitlements
✅ **Group Management**: Create groups and assign users
✅ **Full Admin Access**: Complete control over OSDU system

## Troubleshooting

### If Bootstrap UI Fails
- Check browser console for specific errors
- Verify you're authenticated
- Try manual setup via entitlements page

### If Manual Setup Fails
- Double-check exact email formats
- Ensure you add yourself as a member to ALL groups
- Verify data partition is "osdu"

### If Still Getting Permission Errors
- Log out and back in to refresh tokens
- Check backend logs for specific permission errors
- Verify group memberships in entitlements page
- Ensure entitlements map groups to services
