## ⏱️ Timing Breakdown (15 min total)

| Section | Time | Key Points |
|---------|------|------------|
| Intro & Architecture | 3 min | Agent router, orchestrator, async |
| Simple Query Demo | 3 min | Petrophysics, general knowledge |
| Complex Demo | 4 min | Terrain, layout, orchestration |
| CloudWatch | 2 min | Observability, logs, metrics |
| Starter Kit | 2 min | Templates, examples, deployment |
| Q&A Setup | 1 min | Recap, share links |

## 📝 Demo Queries (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Query 1: Petrophysics (3-5s)
```
Analyze porosity for well NLOG_F02-1 using density method
```
**Expected:** Professional report, visualization, metrics

### Query 2: General Knowledge (2-3s)
```
What's the weather like in Las Vegas today?
```
**Expected:** Conversational response, no artifacts

### Query 3: Terrain Analysis (8-12s async)
```
Analyze wind farm potential at coordinates 35.0, -101.4 with 5km radius
```
**Expected:** Interactive map, 151 features, wind data

### Query 4: Layout Optimization (10-15s async)
```
Optimize turbine layout for this site
```
**Expected:** 25 turbines, energy estimates, wake analysis

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### Agent Router Pattern
- "Specialized agents instead of one monolithic agent"
- "Pattern matching routes queries to the right expert"
- "Graceful fallback to general knowledge"

### Orchestrator Pattern
- "Coordinates multiple tool Lambdas"
- "Maintains project context across queries"
- "Chains complex workflows automatically"

### Async Processing
- "API Gateway has 29-second timeout"
- "Fire-and-forget with polling for long tasks"
- "User gets immediate feedback, results appear when ready"

### Production Grade
- "This isn't a toy - it's running in production"
- "Complete observability with CloudWatch"
- "Cost-effective: $0.002 per complex query"

### Starter Kit
- "Working template, not just documentation"
- "Deploy to your AWS account in one command"
- "First custom agent in 30 minutes"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix | Backup |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Timeout | Wait 10s more | Slide 2 or 3 |
| Auth fail | Use backup tab | Show auth diagram |
| No artifacts | Check S3 logs | Show JSON |
| Wrong agent | Rephrase query | Use tested query |
| Slow WiFi | Mobile hotspot | Screenshots |
| Cold start | Acknowledge & wait | Explain optimization |

## 🆘 Emergency Procedures

### If Live Demo Completely Fails:
1. Press `E` key to show emergency banner on backup slides
2. Say: "Let me show you what this looks like when it works"
3. Walk through backup slides 1-5
4. Maintain energy and enthusiasm
5. Use it as teaching moment: "This is why we test!"

### If One Query Fails:
1. Acknowledge it: "Interesting - let's see what happened"
2. Check CloudWatch logs (teaching moment)
3. Try next query
4. If that fails too → switch to backup slides

### If Internet Fails:
1. Switch to backup slides immediately
2. Use mobile hotspot if available
3. Walk through screenshots
4. Focus on architecture and patterns

## 📱 Browser Tab Layout

```
Tab 1: AWS Console (CloudWatch Logs)
Tab 2: Application UI (logged in)
Tab 3: Backup Slides (backup-slides.html)
Tab 4: GitHub Starter Kit
Tab 5: This cheat sheet
```

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

### Backup Slides:
- `→` or `Space`: Next slide
- `←`: Previous slide
- `Home`: First slide
- `End`: Last slide
- `E`: Toggle emergency banner

### Browser:
- `Cmd/Ctrl + T`: New tab
- `Cmd/Ctrl + W`: Close tab
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Tab`: Switch tabs
- `Cmd/Ctrl + R`: Refresh page

## 📊 Expected Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Simple query | 3-8s | Petrophysics, general |
| Complex query | 8-30s | Terrain, layout, simulation |
| Cold start | +5-10s | First query only |
| Artifact size | 1-3 MB | Maps, visualizations |
| Cost per query | $0.002-0.005 | Very economical |

## 🎤 Opening Lines

"Good afternoon everyone! Today we're diving deep into building multi-agent AI systems on AWS. I'm going to show you a real production system that's running right now, and then we'll look at how you can build something similar."

## 🎤 Closing Lines

"So to recap: agent router pattern for specialized agents, orchestrator pattern for complex workflows, async processing for long-running tasks, production-grade observability, and a starter kit to get you going. The code and documentation are available at [show QR code]. Now, I'd love to hear your questions. Who wants to go first?"

## 🎬 Pre-Demo Checklist (Print This!)

**30 Minutes Before:**
- [ ] All browser tabs open
- [ ] Logged into application
- [ ] CloudWatch logs streaming
- [ ] Backup slides tested
- [ ] Water nearby
- [ ] Bathroom break taken

**5 Minutes Before:**
- [ ] Screen sharing tested
- [ ] Microphone tested
- [ ] One warm-up query executed
- [ ] Audience can see screen
- [ ] Deep breath taken

**During Demo:**
- [ ] Smile
- [ ] Make eye contact
- [ ] Speak clearly
- [ ] Pause for effect
- [ ] Have fun!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Slow Down**: You know this inside out, audience is seeing it first time
2. **Pause After Key Points**: Let them absorb
3. **Acknowledge Failures**: "And this is why we test!" - turns failure into teaching moment
4. **Use Backup Slides Confidently**: They're not a failure, they're a backup plan
5. **Energy Management**: Start high, maintain throughout, end strong
6. **Time Checks**: Glance at clock after each section
7. **Audience Engagement**: "Notice what's happening here?" - rhetorical questions
8. **Technical Credibility**: Use precise terms, acknowledge limitations

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] At least 2 queries executed successfully
- [ ] Showed both simple and complex workflows
