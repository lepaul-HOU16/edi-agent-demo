# Log Curve Inventory Deployment Fix

## Root Cause Analysis

✅ **Working Components:**
- S3 Data Layer: 24 wells with 13-17 log curves each
- LAS File Parsing: Correctly extracts DEPT, CALI, DTC, GR, NPHI, RHOB, etc.
- Local Tool Logic: petrophysicsTools.ts functions work perfectly

❌ **Issue: AWS Lambda Deployment**
- Dynamic imports fail in Lambda: `await import('../tools/petrophysicsTools')`
- Module resolution issues in serverless environment  
- Error handling masks real deployment problem
- Users see "well not found" instead of "tool import failed"

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Static Imports Solution

Replace dynamic imports with static imports in `enhancedStrandsAgent.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Dynamic - Fails in Lambda)
const petrophysicsModule = await import('../tools/petrophysicsTools');

// AFTER (Static - Works in Lambda)  
import { petrophysicsTools } from '../tools/petrophysicsTools';
```

### 2. Pre-compiled Tools Registry

Create static tools registry that loads at compile time:

```typescript
private static toolsRegistry: Map<string, any> = new Map();

static {
  // Initialize tools at class load time
  petrophysicsTools.forEach(tool => {
    this.toolsRegistry.set(tool.name, tool);
  });
}
```

### 3. Deployment Steps

1. **Replace Agent File:**
   ```bash
   cp amplify/functions/agents/enhancedStrandsAgent.ts.fixed amplify/functions/agents/enhancedStrandsAgent.ts
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd amplify/functions/agents
   npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3@^3.400.0 zod@^3.22.0
   ```

3. **Test Compilation:**
   ```bash
   cd amplify/functions/agents
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

4. **Deploy to AWS:**
   ```bash
   npx amplify push --yes
   ```

5. **Test Deployment:**
   ```bash
   node validate-deployed-log-curves.js
   ```

### 4. Validation Commands

Test these commands in your application:
- "list wells" - Should show 24 wells
- "well info WELL-001" - Should show 13 log curves
- "what log curves are available for WELL-001?" - Should list all curves

### 5. Monitoring

Check CloudWatch logs for:
- "FIXED: Initializing static tools registry..."
- "FIXED: Registered tool [tool_name]"
- "FIXED: Tool found in static registry"

If you see "Tool not found in static registry", the static imports may still have issues.

### 6. Troubleshooting

**If tools still not found:**
1. Check TypeScript compilation errors
2. Verify all tool files exist in correct locations
3. Check Lambda bundle includes all dependencies
4. Monitor CloudWatch for import errors

**If curves still appear missing:**
1. Test S3 permissions with debug-log-curve-inventory.js
2. Check Lambda environment variables (S3_BUCKET)
3. Verify Lambda execution role has S3 read permissions

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- ✅ "list wells" returns 24 wells
- ✅ "well info WELL-001" shows 13 curves: DEPT, CALI, DTC, GR, DEEPRESISTIVITY, SHALLOWRESISTIVITY, NPHI, RHOB, LITHOLOGY, VWCL, ENVI, FAULT
- ✅ All petrophysical calculations work normally
- ✅ No more "well not found" errors for valid wells

## Verification

Run this test to confirm the fix:

```javascript
// In browser console or test environment
const testMessages = [
  "list wells",
  "well info WELL-001", 
  "what log curves are available for WELL-001?",
  "calculate porosity for WELL-001"
];

// Each should return successful responses with log curve data
```
