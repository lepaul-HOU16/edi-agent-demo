## Final Checklist (5 min before)

```bash
# 1. Check deployment
tail -20 deployment.log

# 2. Verify core features
# Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

# 3. Check renewable status
node scripts/check-lambda-exists.js

# 4. Choose demo approach
# - If deployed: Full demo
# - If deploying: Code + tests demo
```

## Deployment Status Check

```bash
# Quick status
tail -5 deployment.log

# If you see "✔ Deployment complete" → Full demo
# If you see "Building..." → Code demo with deployment explanation
```

## You're Ready! 🚀
