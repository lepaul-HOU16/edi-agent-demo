# Agents for Energy - Agent Template Alpha - Building AI Agents with LangGraph and AWS Amplify

This project shows an example implimenation of hosting a [LangGraph agent](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) in an AWS Lambda function to process digital operations related energy woakloads. There are a series of [labs](/labs/labs.md) which walk through the process of extending the agent to address a new use case. You'll learn how to persist agent state, create custom tools, build interactive UIs, and deploy agents with AWS Amplify.

## Deploy the Project with AWS Amplify
This option will create a public facing URL which let's users interact with your application.

1. Fork this repository in your company's Github account.

2. Follow the steps in [this tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started-next.html) to deploy the forked repository with AWS Amplify.


## Deploy the Development Environment
This option let's you rapidly deploy changes to the code repository, so you can quickly add new features.

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-agents4energy-agent-template-alpha
cd sample-agents4energy-agent-template-alpha
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```
Then edit the `.env.local` file to add your actual credentials. See [Environment Variables Setup](./docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES_SETUP.md) for more details.

3. Deploy the sandbox environment:
```bash
npx ampx sandbox --stream-function-logs
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser to the local URL (ex: localhost:3000)

6. Create an account by clicking the "Login" button.

7. Create a new chat session by clicking the "Create" button, and try out (or modify) one of the sample prompts.


## Model Context Protocol
The tools in this project are also exposed via an MCP server. You can list the tools using a curl command like the one below. Look in the AWS Cloudformation output for the path to the mcp server, and the ARN of the api key. Use the AWS console to find the value of the api key from it's ARN (navagate to https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/api-keys and click the copy button by the key called "mcp-tools-key".)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  <Path to MCP Server> \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: <Api Key for MCP Server>' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "tools/list"
}'
```
